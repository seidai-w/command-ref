1 A short installation guide
****************************

Unfortunately the installation guide has not been finished in time.
Instead of delaying the release of GnuPG 2.0 even further, I decided to
release without that guide.  The chapter on gpg-agent and gpgsm do
include brief information on how to set up the whole thing.  Please
watch the GnuPG website for updates of the documentation.  In the
meantime you may search the GnuPG mailing list archives or ask on the
gnupg-users mailing list for advise on how to solve problems or how to
get that whole thing up and running.

   ** Building the software

   Building the software is described in the file ‘INSTALL’.  Given that
you are already reading this documentation we can only give some extra
hints.

   To comply with the rules on GNU systems you should have build time
configured ‘gnupg’ using:

     ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var

   This is to make sure that system wide configuration files are
searched in the directory ‘/etc’ and variable data below ‘/var’; the
default would be to also install them below ‘/usr/local’ where the
binaries get installed.  If you selected to use the ‘--prefix=/’ you
obviously don&#39;t need those option as they are the default then.

   ** Notes on setting a root CA key to trusted

   X.509 is based on a hierarchical key infrastructure.  At the root of
the tree a trusted anchor (root certificate) is required.  There are
usually no other means of verifying whether this root certificate is
trustworthy than looking it up in a list.  GnuPG uses a file
(‘trustlist.txt’) to keep track of all root certificates it knows about.
There are 3 ways to get certificates into this list:

   • Use the list which comes with GnuPG. However this list only
     contains a few root certificates.  Most installations will need
     more.

   • Let ‘gpgsm’ ask you whether you want to insert a new root
     certificate.  This feature is enabled by default; you may disable
     it using the option ‘no-allow-mark-trusted’ into ‘gpg-agent.conf’.

   • Manually maintain the list of trusted root certificates.  For a
     multi user installation this can be done once for all users on a
     machine.  Specific changes on a per-user base are also possible.

2 Invoking GPG-AGENT
********************

‘gpg-agent’ is a daemon to manage secret (private) keys independently
from any protocol.  It is used as a backend for ‘gpg’ and ‘gpgsm’ as
well as for a couple of other utilities.

   The agent is automatically started on demand by ‘gpg’, ‘gpgsm’,
‘gpgconf’, or ‘gpg-connect-agent’.  Thus there is no reason to start it
manually.  In case you want to use the included Secure Shell Agent you
may start the agent using:

     gpg-connect-agent /bye

If you want to manually terminate the currently-running agent, you can
safely do so with:

     gpgconf --kill gpg-agent

You should always add the following lines to your ‘.bashrc’ or whatever
initialization file is used for all shell invocations:

     GPG_TTY=$(tty)
     export GPG_TTY

It is important that this environment variable always reflects the
output of the ‘tty’ command.  For W32 systems this option is not
required.

   Please make sure that a proper pinentry program has been installed
under the default filename (which is system dependent) or use the option
‘pinentry-program’ to specify the full name of that program.  It is
often useful to install a symbolic link from the actual used pinentry
(e.g.  ‘/usr/bin/pinentry-gtk’) to the expected one (e.g.
‘/usr/bin/pinentry’).

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent Commands,  Next: Agent Options,  Up: Invoking GPG-AGENT

2.1 Commands
============

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

‘--version’
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--help’
‘-h’
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--dump-options’
     Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--server’
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the ‘stdin’.  The
     default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.

‘--daemon [COMMAND LINE]’
     Start the gpg-agent as a daemon; that is, detach it from the
     console and run it in the background.

     As an alternative you may create a new process as a child of
     gpg-agent: ‘gpg-agent --daemon /bin/sh’.  This way you get a new
     shell with the environment setup properly; after you exit from this
     shell, gpg-agent terminates within a few seconds.

‘--supervised’
     Run in the foreground, sending logs by default to stderr, and
     listening on provided file descriptors, which must already be bound
     to listening sockets.  This option is deprecated and not supported
     on Windows.

     If in ‘common.conf’ the option ‘no-autostart’ is set, any start
     attempts will be ignored.

     In -supervised mode, different file descriptors can be provided for
     use as different socket types (e.g.  ssh, extra) as long as they
     are identified in the environment variable ‘LISTEN_FDNAMES’ (see
     sd_listen_fds(3) on some Linux distributions for more information
     on this convention).

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent Options,  Next: Agent Configuration,  Prev: Agent Commands,  Up: Invoking GPG-AGENT

2.2 Option Summary
==================

Options may either be used on the command line or, after stripping off
the two leading dashes, in the configuration file.

‘--options FILE’
     Reads configuration from FILE instead of from the default per-user
     configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
     ‘gpg-agent.conf’ and expected in the ‘.gnupg’ directory directly
     below the home directory of the user.  This option is ignored if
     used in an options file.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to ‘gpg-agent’, such
     as ‘-vv’.

‘-q’
‘--quiet’
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

‘--batch’
     Don&#39;t invoke a pinentry or do any other thing requiring human
     interaction.

‘--faked-system-time EPOCH’
     This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time
     back or forth to EPOCH which is the number of seconds elapsed since
     the year 1970.

‘--debug-level LEVEL’
     Select the debug level for investigating problems.  LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or a keyword:

     ‘none’
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of the keyword.
     ‘basic’
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘advanced’
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘expert’
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘guru’
          All of the debug messages you can get.  A value greater than 8
          may be used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program.  They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

‘--debug FLAGS’
     Set debug flags.  All flags are or-ed and FLAGS may be given in C
     syntax (e.g.  0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.
     To get a list of all supported flags the single word &quot;help&quot; can be
     used.  This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior
     may change at any time without notice.

‘--debug-all’
     Same as ‘--debug=0xffffffff’

‘--debug-wait N’
     When running in server mode, wait N seconds before entering the
     actual processing loop and print the pid.  This gives time to
     attach a debugger.

‘--debug-quick-random’
     This option inhibits the use of the very secure random quality
     level (Libgcrypt’s ‘GCRY_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM’) and degrades all
     request down to standard random quality.  It is only used for
     testing and should not be used for any production quality keys.
     This option is only effective when given on the command line.

     On GNU/Linux, another way to quickly generate insecure keys is to
     use ‘rngd’ to fill the kernel&#39;s entropy pool with lower quality
     random data.  ‘rngd’ is typically provided by the ‘rng-tools’
     package.  It can be run as follows: ‘sudo rngd -f -r /dev/urandom’.

‘--debug-pinentry’
     This option enables extra debug information pertaining to the
     Pinentry.  As of now it is only useful when used along with
     ‘--debug 1024’.

‘--no-detach’
     Don&#39;t detach the process from the console.  This is mainly useful
     for debugging.

‘--steal-socket’
     In ‘--daemon’ mode, gpg-agent detects an already running gpg-agent
     and does not allow one to start a new instance.  This option can be
     used to override this check: the new gpg-agent process will try to
     take over the communication sockets from the already running
     process and start anyway.  This option should in general not be
     used.

‘-s’
‘--sh’
‘-c’
‘--csh’
     Format the info output in daemon mode for use with the standard
     Bourne shell or the C-shell respectively.  The default is to guess
     it based on the environment variable ‘SHELL’ which is correct in
     almost all cases.

‘--grab’
‘--no-grab’
     Tell the pinentry to grab the keyboard and mouse.  This option
     should be used on X-Servers to avoid X-sniffing attacks.  Any use
     of the option ‘--grab’ overrides an used option ‘--no-grab’.  The
     default is ‘--no-grab’.

‘--log-file FILE’
     Append all logging output to FILE.  This is very helpful in seeing
     what the agent actually does.  Use ‘socket://’ to log to socket.
     If neither a log file nor a log file descriptor has been set on a
     Windows platform, the Registry entry
     ‘HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:DefaultLogFile’, if set, is used to
     specify the logging output.

‘--no-allow-mark-trusted’
     Do not allow clients to mark keys as trusted, i.e.  put them into
     the ‘trustlist.txt’ file.  This makes it harder for users to
     inadvertently accept Root-CA keys.

‘--no-user-trustlist’
     Entirely ignore the user trust list and consider only the global
     trustlist (‘/etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt’).  This implies the *note
     option --no-allow-mark-trusted::.

‘--sys-trustlist-name FILE’
     Changes the default name for the global trustlist from
     &quot;trustlist.txt&quot; to FILE.  If FILE does not contain any slashes and
     does not start with &quot;~/&quot; it is searched in the system configuration
     directory (‘/etc/gnupg’).

‘--allow-preset-passphrase’
     This option allows the use of ‘gpg-preset-passphrase’ to seed the
     internal cache of ‘gpg-agent’ with passphrases.

‘--no-allow-loopback-pinentry’
‘--allow-loopback-pinentry’
     Disallow or allow clients to use the loopback pinentry features;
     see the option ‘pinentry-mode’ for details.  Allow is the default.

     The ‘--force’ option of the Assuan command ‘DELETE_KEY’ is also
     controlled by this option: The option is ignored if a loopback
     pinentry is disallowed.

‘--no-allow-external-cache’
     Tell Pinentry not to enable features which use an external cache
     for passphrases.

     Some desktop environments prefer to unlock all credentials with one
     master password and may have installed a Pinentry which employs an
     additional external cache to implement such a policy.  By using
     this option the Pinentry is advised not to make use of such a cache
     and instead always ask the user for the requested passphrase.

‘--allow-emacs-pinentry’
     Tell Pinentry to allow features to divert the passphrase entry to a
     running Emacs instance.  How this is exactly handled depends on the
     version of the used Pinentry.

‘--ignore-cache-for-signing’
     This option will let ‘gpg-agent’ bypass the passphrase cache for
     all signing operation.  Note that there is also a per-session
     option to control this behavior but this command line option takes
     precedence.

‘--default-cache-ttl N’
     Set the time a cache entry is valid to N seconds.  The default is
     600 seconds.  Each time a cache entry is accessed, the entry&#39;s
     timer is reset.  To set an entry&#39;s maximum lifetime, use
     ‘max-cache-ttl’.  Note that a cached passphrase may not be evicted
     immediately from memory if no client requests a cache operation.
     This is due to an internal housekeeping function which is only run
     every few seconds.

‘--default-cache-ttl-ssh N’
     Set the time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to N seconds.
     The default is 1800 seconds.  Each time a cache entry is accessed,
     the entry&#39;s timer is reset.  To set an entry&#39;s maximum lifetime,
     use ‘max-cache-ttl-ssh’.

‘--max-cache-ttl N’
     Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to N seconds.  After
     this time a cache entry will be expired even if it has been
     accessed recently or has been set using ‘gpg-preset-passphrase’.
     The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).

‘--max-cache-ttl-ssh N’
     Set the maximum time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to N
     seconds.  After this time a cache entry will be expired even if it
     has been accessed recently or has been set using
     ‘gpg-preset-passphrase’.  The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).

‘--enforce-passphrase-constraints’
     Enforce the passphrase constraints by not allowing the user to
     bypass them using the &quot;Take it anyway&quot; button.

‘--min-passphrase-len N’
     Set the minimal length of a passphrase.  When entering a new
     passphrase shorter than this value a warning will be displayed.
     Defaults to 8.

‘--min-passphrase-nonalpha N’
     Set the minimal number of digits or special characters required in
     a passphrase.  When entering a new passphrase with less than this
     number of digits or special characters a warning will be displayed.
     Defaults to 1.

‘--check-passphrase-pattern FILE’
‘--check-sym-passphrase-pattern FILE’
     Check the passphrase against the pattern given in FILE.  When
     entering a new passphrase matching one of these pattern a warning
     will be displayed.  If FILE does not contain any slashes and does
     not start with &quot;~/&quot; it is searched in the system configuration
     directory (‘/etc/gnupg’).  The default is not to use any pattern
     file.  The second version of this option is only used when creating
     a new symmetric key to allow the use of different patterns for such
     passphrases.

     Security note: It is known that checking a passphrase against a
     list of pattern or even against a complete dictionary is not very
     effective to enforce good passphrases.  Users will soon figure up
     ways to bypass such a policy.  A better policy is to educate users
     on good security behavior and optionally to run a passphrase
     cracker regularly on all users passphrases to catch the very simple
     ones.

‘--max-passphrase-days N’
     Ask the user to change the passphrase if N days have passed since
     the last change.  With ‘--enforce-passphrase-constraints’ set the
     user may not bypass this check.

‘--enable-passphrase-history’
     This option does nothing yet.

‘--pinentry-invisible-char CHAR’
     This option asks the Pinentry to use CHAR for displaying hidden
     characters.  CHAR must be one character UTF-8 string.  A Pinentry
     may or may not honor this request.

‘--pinentry-timeout N’
     This option asks the Pinentry to timeout after N seconds with no
     user input.  The default value of 0 does not ask the pinentry to
     timeout, however a Pinentry may use its own default timeout value
     in this case.  A Pinentry may or may not honor this request.

‘--pinentry-formatted-passphrase’
     This option asks the Pinentry to enable passphrase formatting when
     asking the user for a new passphrase and masking of the passphrase
     is turned off.

     If passphrase formatting is enabled, then all non-breaking space
     characters are stripped from the entered passphrase.  Passphrase
     formatting is mostly useful in combination with passphrases
     generated with the GENPIN feature of some Pinentries.  Note that
     such a generated passphrase, if not modified by the user, skips all
     passphrase constraints checking because such constraints would
     actually weaken the generated passphrase.

‘--pinentry-program FILENAME’
     Use program FILENAME as the PIN entry.  The default is installation
     dependent.  With the default configuration the name of the default
     pinentry is ‘pinentry’; if that file does not exist but a
     ‘pinentry-basic’ exist the latter is used.

     On a Windows platform the default is to use the first existing
     program from this list: ‘bin\pinentry.exe’,
     ‘..\Gpg4win\bin\pinentry.exe’, ‘..\Gpg4win\pinentry.exe’,
     ‘..\GNU\GnuPG\pinentry.exe’, ‘..\GNU\bin\pinentry.exe’,
     ‘bin\pinentry-basic.exe’ where the file names are relative to the
     GnuPG installation directory.

‘--pinentry-touch-file FILENAME’
     By default the filename of the socket gpg-agent is listening for
     requests is passed to Pinentry, so that it can touch that file
     before exiting (it does this only in curses mode).  This option
     changes the file passed to Pinentry to FILENAME.  The special name
     ‘/dev/null’ may be used to completely disable this feature.  Note
     that Pinentry will not create that file, it will only change the
     modification and access time.

‘--scdaemon-program FILENAME’
     Use program FILENAME as the Smartcard daemon.  The default is
     installation dependent and can be shown with the ‘gpgconf’ command.

‘--disable-scdaemon’
     Do not make use of the scdaemon tool.  This option has the effect
     of disabling the ability to do smartcard operations.  Note, that
     enabling this option at runtime does not kill an already forked
     scdaemon.

‘--disable-check-own-socket’
     ‘gpg-agent’ employs a periodic self-test to detect a stolen socket.
     This usually means a second instance of ‘gpg-agent’ has taken over
     the socket and ‘gpg-agent’ will then terminate itself.  This option
     may be used to disable this self-test for debugging purposes.

‘--use-standard-socket’
‘--no-use-standard-socket’
‘--use-standard-socket-p’
     Since GnuPG 2.1 the standard socket is always used.  These options
     have no more effect.  The command ‘gpg-agent
     --use-standard-socket-p’ will thus always return success.

‘--display STRING’
‘--ttyname STRING’
‘--ttytype STRING’
‘--lc-ctype STRING’
‘--lc-messages STRING’
‘--xauthority STRING’
     These options are used with the server mode to pass localization
     information.

‘--keep-tty’
‘--keep-display’
     Ignore requests to change the current ‘tty’ or X window system&#39;s
     ‘DISPLAY’ variable respectively.  This is useful to lock the
     pinentry to pop up at the ‘tty’ or display you started the agent.

‘--listen-backlog N’
     Set the size of the queue for pending connections.  The default is
     64.

‘--extra-socket NAME’
     The extra socket is created by default, you may use this option to
     change the name of the socket.  To disable the creation of the
     socket use &quot;none&quot; or &quot;/dev/null&quot; for NAME.

     Also listen on native gpg-agent connections on the given socket.
     The intended use for this extra socket is to setup a Unix domain
     socket forwarding from a remote machine to this socket on the local
     machine.  A ‘gpg’ running on the remote machine may then connect to
     the local gpg-agent and use its private keys.  This enables
     decrypting or signing data on a remote machine without exposing the
     private keys to the remote machine.

‘--enable-extended-key-format’
‘--disable-extended-key-format’
     These options are obsolete and have no effect.  The extended key
     format is used for years now and has been supported since 2.1.12.
     Existing keys in the old format are migrated to the new format as
     soon as they are touched.

‘--enable-ssh-support’
‘--enable-win32-openssh-support’
‘--enable-putty-support’

     On Unix platforms the OpenSSH Agent protocol is always enabled, but
     ‘gpg-agent’ will only set the ‘SSH_AUTH_SOCK’ variable if the
     option ‘enable-ssh-support’ is given.  Some Linux distributions use
     the presence of this option to decide whether the old ssh-agent
     shall be started.

     On Windows support for the native ssh implementation must be
     enabled using the the option ‘enable-win32-openssh-support’.  For
     using gpg-agent as a replacement for PuTTY&#39;s Pageant, the option
     ‘enable-putty-support’ must be enabled.

     In this mode of operation, the agent does not only implement the
     gpg-agent protocol, but also the agent protocol used by OpenSSH
     (through a separate socket or via Named Pipes) or the protocol used
     by PuTTY. Consequently, this allows one to use the gpg-agent as a
     drop-in replacement for the ssh-agent.

     SSH keys, which are to be used through the agent, need to be added
     to the gpg-agent initially through the ssh-add utility.  When a key
     is added, ssh-add will ask for the password of the provided key
     file and send the unprotected key material to the agent; this
     causes the gpg-agent to ask for a passphrase, which is to be used
     for encrypting the newly received key and storing it in a gpg-agent
     specific directory.

     Once a key has been added to the gpg-agent this way, the gpg-agent
     will be ready to use the key.

     Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature request, the user
     might need to be prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for
     decrypting the stored key.  Since the ssh-agent protocol does not
     contain a mechanism for telling the agent on which display/terminal
     it is running, gpg-agent&#39;s ssh-support will use the TTY or X
     display where gpg-agent has been started.  To switch this display
     to the current one, the following command may be used:

          gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye

     Although all GnuPG components try to start the gpg-agent as needed,
     this is not possible for the ssh support because ssh does not know
     about it.  Thus if no GnuPG tool which accesses the agent has been
     run, there is no guarantee that ssh is able to use gpg-agent for
     authentication.  To fix this you may start gpg-agent if needed
     using this simple command:

          gpg-connect-agent /bye

     Adding the ‘--verbose’ shows the progress of starting the agent.

     The ‘--enable-putty-support’ is only available under Windows and
     allows the use of gpg-agent with the ssh implementation ‘putty’.
     This is similar to the regular ssh-agent support but makes use of
     Windows message queue as required by ‘putty’.

     The order in which keys are presented to ssh are:

     ‘Negative Use-for-ssh values’
          If a key file has the attribute &quot;Use-for-ssh&quot; and its value is
          negative, these keys are presented first to ssh.  The negative
          values are capped at -999 with -999 being lower ranked than
          -1.  These values can be used to prefer on-disk keys over keys
          taken from active cards.

     ‘Active cards’
          Active cards (inserted into a card reader or plugged in
          tokens) are always tried; they are ordered by their serial
          numbers.

     ‘Keys listed in the sshcontrol file’
          Non-disabled keys from the sshcontrol file are presented in
          the order they appear in this file.  Note that the sshcontrol
          file is deprecated.

     ‘Positive Use-for-ssh values’
          If a key file has the attribute &quot;Use-for-ssh&quot; and its value is
          &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, or any positive number the key is presented in
          the order of their values.  &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;true&quot; have a value of
          1; other values are capped at 99999.

     Editing the &quot;Use-for-ssh&quot; values can be done with an editor or
     using ‘gpg-connect-agent’ and &quot;KEYATTR&quot; (Remember to append a colon
     to the key; i.e.  use &quot;Use-for-ssh:&quot;).

‘--ssh-fingerprint-digest’

     Select the digest algorithm used to compute ssh fingerprints that
     are communicated to the user, e.g.  in pinentry dialogs.  OpenSSH
     has transitioned from using MD5 to the more secure SHA256.

‘--auto-expand-secmem N’
     Allow Libgcrypt to expand its secure memory area as required.  The
     optional value N is a non-negative integer with a suggested size in
     bytes of each additionally allocated secure memory area.  The value
     is rounded up to the next 32 KiB; usual C style prefixes are
     allowed.  For an heavy loaded gpg-agent with many concurrent
     connection this option avoids sign or decrypt errors due to out of
     secure memory error returns.

‘--s2k-calibration MILLISECONDS’
     Change the default calibration time to MILLISECONDS.  The given
     value is capped at 60 seconds; a value of 0 resets to the
     compiled-in default.  This option is re-read on a SIGHUP (or
     ‘gpgconf --reload gpg-agent’) and the S2K count is then
     re-calibrated.

‘--s2k-count N’
     Specify the iteration count used to protect the passphrase.  This
     option can be used to override the auto-calibration done by
     default.  The auto-calibration computes a count which requires by
     default 100ms to mangle a given passphrase.  See also
     ‘--s2k-calibration’.

     To view the actually used iteration count and the milliseconds
     required for an S2K operation use:

          gpg-connect-agent &#39;GETINFO s2k_count&#39; /bye
          gpg-connect-agent &#39;GETINFO s2k_time&#39; /bye

     To view the auto-calibrated count use:

          gpg-connect-agent &#39;GETINFO s2k_count_cal&#39; /bye

2.3 Configuration
=================

There are a few configuration files needed for the operation of the
agent.  By default they may all be found in the current home directory
(*note option --homedir::).

‘gpg-agent.conf’
     This is the standard configuration file read by ‘gpg-agent’ on
     startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two
     dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
     This file is also read after a ‘SIGHUP’ however only a few options
     will actually have an effect.  This default name may be changed on
     the command line (*note option --options::).  You should backup
     this file.

‘trustlist.txt’
     This is the list of trusted keys.  You should backup this file.

     Comment lines, indicated by a leading hash mark, as well as empty
     lines are ignored.  To mark a key as trusted you need to enter its
     fingerprint followed by a space and a capital letter ‘S’.  Colons
     may optionally be used to separate the bytes of a fingerprint; this
     enables cutting and pasting the fingerprint from a key listing
     output.  If the line is prefixed with a ‘!’ the key is explicitly
     marked as not trusted.

     Here is an example where two keys are marked as ultimately trusted
     and one as not trusted:

            # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
            A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S

            # CN=PCA-1-Verwaltung-02/O=PKI-1-Verwaltung/C=DE
            DC:BD:69:25:48:BD:BB:7E:31:6E:BB:80:D3:00:80:35:D4:F8:A6:CD S

            # CN=Root-CA/O=Schlapphuete/L=Pullach/C=DE
            !14:56:98:D3:FE:9C:CA:5A:31:6E:BC:81:D3:11:4E:00:90:A3:44:C2 S

     Before entering a key into this file, you need to ensure its
     authenticity.  How to do this depends on your organisation; your
     administrator might have already entered those keys which are
     deemed trustworthy enough into this file.  Places where to look for
     the fingerprint of a root certificate are letters received from the
     CA or the website of the CA (after making 100% sure that this is
     indeed the website of that CA). You may want to consider
     disallowing interactive updates of this file by using the *note
     option --no-allow-mark-trusted::.  It might even be advisable to
     change the permissions to read-only so that this file can&#39;t be
     changed inadvertently.

     As a special feature a line ‘include-default’ will include a global
     list of trusted certificates (e.g.  ‘/etc/gnupg/trustlist.txt’).
     This global list is also used if the local list is not available;
     the *note option --no-user-trustlist:: enforces the use of only
     this global list.

     It is possible to add further flags after the ‘S’ for use by the
     caller:

     ‘relax’
          Relax checking of some root certificate requirements.  As of
          now this flag allows the use of root certificates with a
          missing basicConstraints attribute (despite that it is a MUST
          for CA certificates) and disables CRL checking for the root
          certificate.

     ‘cm’
          If validation of a certificate finally issued by a CA with
          this flag set fails, try again using the chain validation
          model.

     ‘qual’
          The CA is allowed to issue certificates for qualified
          signatures.  This flag has an effect only if used in the
          global list.  This is now the preferred way to mark such CA;
          the old way of having a separate file ‘qualified.txt’ is still
          supported.

     ‘de-vs’
          The CA is part of an approved PKI for the German
          classification level VS-NfD. It is only valid in the global
          trustlist.  As of now this is used only for documentation
          purpose.

‘sshcontrol’
     This file is used when support for the secure shell agent protocol
     has been enabled (*note option --enable-ssh-support::).  Only keys
     present in this file are used in the SSH protocol.  You should
     backup this file.

     This file is deprecated in favor of the &quot;Use-for-ssh&quot; attribute in
     the key files.

     The ‘ssh-add’ tool may be used to add new entries to this file; you
     may also add them manually.  Comment lines, indicated by a leading
     hash mark, as well as empty lines are ignored.  An entry starts
     with optional whitespace, followed by the keygrip of the key given
     as 40 hex digits, optionally followed by the caching TTL in seconds
     and another optional field for arbitrary flags.  A non-zero TTL
     overrides the global default as set by ‘--default-cache-ttl-ssh’.

     The only flag support is ‘confirm’.  If this flag is found for a
     key, each use of the key will pop up a pinentry to confirm the use
     of that key.  The flag is automatically set if a new key was loaded
     into ‘gpg-agent’ using the option ‘-c’ of the ‘ssh-add’ command.

     The keygrip may be prefixed with a ‘!’ to disable an entry.

     The following example lists exactly one key.  Note that keys
     available through a OpenPGP smartcard in the active smartcard
     reader are implicitly added to this list; i.e.  there is no need to
     list them.

                 # Key added on: 2011-07-20 20:38:46
                 # Fingerprint:  5e:8d:c4:ad:e7:af:6e:27:8a:d6:13:e4:79:ad:0b:81
                 34B62F25E277CF13D3C6BCEBFD3F85D08F0A864B 0 confirm

‘private-keys-v1.d/’

     This is the directory where gpg-agent stores the private keys.
     Each key is stored in a file with the name made up of the keygrip
     and the suffix ‘key’.  You should backup all files in this
     directory and take great care to keep this backup closed away.

   Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined
files into the directory ‘/etc/skel/.gnupg’ so that newly created users
start up with a working configuration.  For existing users the a small
helper script is provided to create these files (*note addgnupghome::).

2.4 Use of some signals
=======================

A running ‘gpg-agent’ may be controlled by signals, i.e.  using the
‘kill’ command to send a signal to the process.

   Here is a list of supported signals:

‘SIGHUP’
     This signal flushes all cached passphrases and if the program has
     been started with a configuration file, the configuration file is
     read again.  Only certain options are honored: ‘quiet’, ‘verbose’,
     ‘debug’, ‘debug-all’, ‘debug-level’, ‘debug-pinentry’, ‘no-grab’,
     ‘pinentry-program’, ‘pinentry-invisible-char’, ‘default-cache-ttl’,
     ‘max-cache-ttl’, ‘ignore-cache-for-signing’, ‘s2k-count’,
     ‘no-allow-external-cache’, ‘allow-emacs-pinentry’,
     ‘no-allow-mark-trusted’, ‘disable-scdaemon’, and
     ‘disable-check-own-socket’.  ‘scdaemon-program’ is also supported
     but due to the current implementation, which calls the scdaemon
     only once, it is not of much use unless you manually kill the
     scdaemon.

‘SIGTERM’
     Shuts down the process but waits until all current requests are
     fulfilled.  If the process has received 3 of these signals and
     requests are still pending, a shutdown is forced.

‘SIGINT’
     Shuts down the process immediately.

‘SIGUSR1’
     Dump internal information to the log file.

‘SIGUSR2’
     This signal is used for internal purposes.

2.5 Examples
============

It is important to set the environment variable ‘GPG_TTY’ in your login
shell, for example in the ‘~/.bashrc’ init script:

       export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

   If you enabled the Ssh Agent Support, you also need to tell ssh about
it by adding this to your init script:

     unset SSH_AGENT_PID
     if [ &quot;${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}&quot; -ne $$ ]; then
       export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=&quot;$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)&quot;
     fi

2.6 Agent&#39;s Assuan Protocol
===========================

Note: this section does only document the protocol, which is used by
GnuPG components; it does not deal with the ssh-agent protocol.  To see
the full specification of each command, use

       gpg-connect-agent &#39;help COMMAND&#39; /bye

or just &#39;help&#39; to list all available commands.

The ‘gpg-agent’ daemon is started on demand by the GnuPG components.

   To identify a key we use a thing called keygrip which is the SHA-1
hash of an canonical encoded S-Expression of the public key as used in
Libgcrypt.  For the purpose of this interface the keygrip is given as a
hex string.  The advantage of using this and not the hash of a
certificate is that it will be possible to use the same keypair for
different protocols, thereby saving space on the token used to keep the
secret keys.

   The ‘gpg-agent’ may send status messages during a command or when
returning from a command to inform a client about the progress or result
of an operation.  For example, the INQUIRE_MAXLEN status message may be
sent during a server inquire to inform the client of the maximum usable
length of the inquired data (which should not be exceeded).

2.6.1 Decrypting a session key
------------------------------

The client asks the server to decrypt a session key.  The encrypted
session key should have all information needed to select the appropriate
secret key or to delegate it to a smartcard.

       SETKEY &lt;keyGrip&gt;

   Tell the server about the key to be used for decryption.  If this is
not used, ‘gpg-agent’ may try to figure out the key by trying to decrypt
the message with each key available.

       PKDECRYPT

   The agent checks whether this command is allowed and then does an
INQUIRY to get the ciphertext the client should then send the cipher
text.

         S: INQUIRE CIPHERTEXT
         C: D (xxxxxx
         C: D xxxx)
         C: END

   Please note that the server may send status info lines while reading
the data lines from the client.  The data send is a SPKI like S-Exp with
this structure:

          (enc-val
            (&lt;algo&gt;
              (&lt;param_name1&gt; &lt;mpi&gt;)
           ...
              (&lt;param_namen&gt; &lt;mpi&gt;)))

   Where algo is a string with the name of the algorithm; see the
libgcrypt documentation for a list of valid algorithms.  The number and
names of the parameters depend on the algorithm.  The agent does return
an error if there is an inconsistency.

   If the decryption was successful the decrypted data is returned by
means of &quot;D&quot; lines.

   Here is an example session:
        C: PKDECRYPT
        S: INQUIRE CIPHERTEXT
        C: D (enc-val elg (a 349324324)
        C: D    (b 3F444677CA)))
        C: END
        S: # session key follows
        S: S PADDING 0
        S: D (value 1234567890ABCDEF0)
        S: OK decryption successful

   The “PADDING” status line is only send if gpg-agent can tell what
kind of padding is used.  As of now only the value 0 is used to indicate
that the padding has been removed.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent PKSIGN,  Next: Agent GENKEY,  Prev: Agent PKDECRYPT,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.2 Signing a Hash
--------------------

The client asks the agent to sign a given hash value.  A default key
will be chosen if no key has been set.  To set a key a client first
uses:

        SIGKEY &lt;keyGrip&gt;

   This can be used multiple times to create multiple signature, the
list of keys is reset with the next PKSIGN command or a RESET. The
server tests whether the key is a valid key to sign something and
responds with okay.

        SETHASH --hash=&lt;name&gt;|&lt;algo&gt; &lt;hexstring&gt;

   The client can use this command to tell the server about the data
&lt;hexstring&gt; (which usually is a hash) to be signed.  &lt;algo&gt; is the
decimal encoded hash algorithm number as used by Libgcrypt.  Either
&lt;algo&gt; or -hash=&lt;name&gt; must be given.  Valid names for &lt;name&gt; are:

‘sha1’
     The SHA-1 hash algorithm
‘sha256’
     The SHA-256 hash algorithm
‘rmd160’
     The RIPE-MD160 hash algorithm
‘md5’
     The old and broken MD5 hash algorithm
‘tls-md5sha1’
     A combined hash algorithm as used by the TLS protocol.

The actual signing is done using

        PKSIGN &lt;options&gt;

   Options are not yet defined, but may later be used to choose among
different algorithms.  The agent does then some checks, asks for the
passphrase and as a result the server returns the signature as an SPKI
like S-expression in &quot;D&quot; lines:

          (sig-val
            (&lt;algo&gt;
              (&lt;param_name1&gt; &lt;mpi&gt;)
           ...
              (&lt;param_namen&gt; &lt;mpi&gt;)))

   The operation is affected by the option

        OPTION use-cache-for-signing=0|1

   The default of ‘1’ uses the cache.  Setting this option to ‘0’ will
lead ‘gpg-agent’ to ignore the passphrase cache.  Note, that there is
also a global command line option for ‘gpg-agent’ to globally disable
the caching.

   Here is an example session:
        C: SIGKEY &lt;keyGrip&gt;
        S: OK key available
        C: SIGKEY &lt;keyGrip&gt;
        S: OK key available
        C: PKSIGN
        S: # I did ask the user whether he really wants to sign
        S: # I did ask the user for the passphrase
        S: INQUIRE HASHVAL
        C: D ABCDEF012345678901234
        C: END
        S: # signature follows
        S: D (sig-val rsa (s 45435453654612121212))
        S: OK

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent GENKEY,  Next: Agent IMPORT,  Prev: Agent PKSIGN,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.3 Generating a Key
----------------------

This is used to create a new keypair and store the secret key inside the
active PSE -- which is in most cases a Soft-PSE. A not-yet-defined
option allows choosing the storage location.  To get the secret key out
of the PSE, a special export tool has to be used.

        GENKEY [--no-protection] [--preset] [&lt;cache_nonce&gt;]

   Invokes the key generation process and the server will then inquire
on the generation parameters, like:

        S: INQUIRE KEYPARM
        C: D (genkey (rsa (nbits  1024)))
        C: END

   The format of the key parameters which depends on the algorithm is of
the form:

         (genkey
           (algo
             (parameter_name_1 ....)
               ....
             (parameter_name_n ....)))

   If everything succeeds, the server returns the *public key* in a SPKI
like S-Expression like this:

          (public-key
            (rsa
         (n &lt;mpi&gt;)
         (e &lt;mpi&gt;)))

   Here is an example session:
        C: GENKEY
        S: INQUIRE KEYPARM
        C: D (genkey (rsa (nbits  1024)))
        C: END
        S: D (public-key
        S: D   (rsa (n 326487324683264) (e 10001)))
        S  OK key created

   The ‘--no-protection’ option may be used to prevent prompting for a
passphrase to protect the secret key while leaving the secret key
unprotected.  The ‘--preset’ option may be used to add the passphrase to
the cache using the default cache parameters.

   The ‘--inq-passwd’ option may be used to create the key with a
supplied passphrase.  When used the agent does an inquiry with the
keyword ‘NEWPASSWD’ to retrieve that passphrase.  This option takes
precedence over ‘--no-protection’; however if the client sends a empty
(zero-length) passphrase, this is identical to ‘--no-protection’.

2.6.4 Importing a Secret Key
----------------------------

This operation is not yet supported by GpgAgent.  Specialized tools are
to be used for this.

   There is no actual need because we can expect that secret keys
created by a 3rd party are stored on a smartcard.  If we have generated
the key ourselves, we do not need to import it.

2.6.5 Export a Secret Key
-------------------------

Not implemented.

   Should be done by an extra tool.

2.6.6 Importing a Root Certificate
----------------------------------

Actually we do not import a Root Cert but provide a way to validate any
piece of data by storing its Hash along with a description and an
identifier in the PSE. Here is the interface description:

         ISTRUSTED &lt;fingerprint&gt;

   Check whether the OpenPGP primary key or the X.509 certificate with
the given fingerprint is an ultimately trusted key or a trusted Root CA
certificate.  The fingerprint should be given as a hexstring (without
any blanks or colons or whatever in between) and may be left padded with
00 in case of an MD5 fingerprint.  GPGAgent will answer with:

         OK

   The key is in the table of trusted keys.

         ERR 304 (Not Trusted)

   The key is not in this table.

   Gpg needs the entire list of trusted keys to maintain the web of
trust; the following command is therefore quite helpful:

         LISTTRUSTED

   GpgAgent returns a list of trusted keys line by line:

         S: D 000000001234454556565656677878AF2F1ECCFF P
         S: D 340387563485634856435645634856438576457A P
         S: D FEDC6532453745367FD83474357495743757435D S
         S: OK

   The first item on a line is the hexified fingerprint where MD5
fingerprints are ‘00’ padded to the left and the second item is a flag
to indicate the type of key (so that gpg is able to only take care of
PGP keys).  P = OpenPGP, S = S/MIME. A client should ignore the rest of
the line, so that we can extend the format in the future.

   Finally a client should be able to mark a key as trusted:

        MARKTRUSTED FINGERPRINT &quot;P&quot;|&quot;S&quot;

   The server will then pop up a window to ask the user whether she
really trusts this key.  For this it will probably ask for a text to be
displayed like this:

        S: INQUIRE TRUSTDESC
        C: D Do you trust the key with the fingerprint @FPR@
        C: D bla fasel blurb.
        C: END
        S: OK

   Known sequences with the pattern @foo@ are replaced according to this
table:

‘@FPR16@’
     Format the fingerprint according to gpg rules for a v3 keys.
‘@FPR20@’
     Format the fingerprint according to gpg rules for a v4 keys.
‘@FPR@’
     Choose an appropriate format to format the fingerprint.
‘@@’
     Replaced by a single ‘@’.

2.6.7 Ask for a passphrase
--------------------------

This function is usually used to ask for a passphrase to be used for
symmetric encryption, but may also be used by programs which need
special handling of passphrases.  This command uses a syntax which helps
clients to use the agent with minimum effort.

       GET_PASSPHRASE [--data] [--check] [--no-ask] [--repeat[=N]] \
                      [--qualitybar] CACHE_ID                \
                      [ERROR_MESSAGE PROMPT DESCRIPTION]

   CACHE_ID is expected to be a string used to identify a cached
passphrase.  Use a ‘X’ to bypass the cache.  With no other arguments the
agent returns a cached passphrase or an error.  By convention either the
hexified fingerprint of the key shall be used for CACHE_ID or an
arbitrary string prefixed with the name of the calling application and a
colon: Like ‘gpg:somestring’.

   ERROR_MESSAGE is either a single ‘X’ for no error message or a string
to be shown as an error message like (e.g.  &quot;invalid passphrase&quot;).
Blanks must be percent escaped or replaced by ‘+’&#39;.

   PROMPT is either a single ‘X’ for a default prompt or the text to be
shown as the prompt.  Blanks must be percent escaped or replaced by ‘+’.

   DESCRIPTION is a text shown above the entry field.  Blanks must be
percent escaped or replaced by ‘+’.

   The agent either returns with an error or with a OK followed by the
hex encoded passphrase.  Note that the length of the strings is
implicitly limited by the maximum length of a command.  If the option
‘--data’ is used, the passphrase is not returned on the OK line but by
regular data lines; this is the preferred method.

   If the option ‘--check’ is used, the standard passphrase constraints
checks are applied.  A check is not done if the passphrase has been
found in the cache.

   If the option ‘--no-ask’ is used and the passphrase is not in the
cache the user will not be asked to enter a passphrase but the error
code ‘GPG_ERR_NO_DATA’ is returned.

   If the option ‘--qualitybar’ is used and a minimum passphrase length
has been configured, a visual indication of the entered passphrase
quality is shown.

       CLEAR_PASSPHRASE CACHE_ID

   may be used to invalidate the cache entry for a passphrase.  The
function returns with OK even when there is no cached passphrase.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent CLEAR_PASSPHRASE,  Next: Agent PRESET_PASSPHRASE,  Prev: Agent GET_PASSPHRASE,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.8 Remove a cached passphrase
--------------------------------

Use this command to remove a cached passphrase.

       CLEAR_PASSPHRASE [--mode=normal] &lt;cache_id&gt;

   The ‘--mode=normal’ option can be used to clear a CACHE_ID that was
set by gpg-agent.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent PRESET_PASSPHRASE,  Next: Agent GET_CONFIRMATION,  Prev: Agent CLEAR_PASSPHRASE,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.9 Set a passphrase for a keygrip
------------------------------------

This command adds a passphrase to the cache for the specified KEYGRIP.

       PRESET_PASSPHRASE [--inquire] &lt;string_or_keygrip&gt; &lt;timeout&gt; [&lt;hexstring&gt;]

   The passphrase is a hexadecimal string when specified.  When not
specified, the passphrase will be retrieved from the pinentry module
unless the ‘--inquire’ option was specified in which case the passphrase
will be retrieved from the client.

   The TIMEOUT parameter keeps the passphrase cached for the specified
number of seconds.  A value of ‘-1’ means infinite while ‘0’ means the
default (currently only a timeout of -1 is allowed, which means to never
expire it).

2.6.10 Ask for confirmation
---------------------------

This command may be used to ask for a simple confirmation by presenting
a text and 2 buttons: Okay and Cancel.

       GET_CONFIRMATION DESCRIPTION

   DESCRIPTIONis displayed along with a Okay and Cancel button.  Blanks
must be percent escaped or replaced by ‘+’.  A ‘X’ may be used to
display confirmation dialog with a default text.

   The agent either returns with an error or with a OK. Note, that the
length of DESCRIPTION is implicitly limited by the maximum length of a
command.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent HAVEKEY,  Next: Agent LEARN,  Prev: Agent GET_CONFIRMATION,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.11 Check whether a key is available
---------------------------------------

This can be used to see whether a secret key is available.  It does not
return any information on whether the key is somehow protected.

       HAVEKEY KEYGRIPS

   The agent answers either with OK or ‘No_Secret_Key’ (208).  The
caller may want to check for other error codes as well.  More than one
keygrip may be given.  In this case the command returns success if at
least one of the keygrips corresponds to an available secret key.

2.6.12 Register a smartcard
---------------------------

       LEARN [--send]

   This command is used to register a smartcard.  With the ‘--send’
option given the certificates are sent back.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent PASSWD,  Next: Agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY,  Prev: Agent LEARN,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.13 Change a Passphrase
--------------------------

       PASSWD [--cache-nonce=&lt;c&gt;] [--passwd-nonce=&lt;s&gt;] [--preset] KEYGRIP

   This command is used to interactively change the passphrase of the
key identified by the hex string KEYGRIP.  The ‘--preset’ option may be
used to add the new passphrase to the cache using the default cache
parameters.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY,  Next: Agent GETEVENTCOUNTER,  Prev: Agent PASSWD,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.14 Change the standard display
----------------------------------

       UPDATESTARTUPTTY

   Set the startup TTY and X-DISPLAY variables to the values of this
session.  This command is useful to direct future pinentry invocations
to another screen.  It is only required because there is no way in the
ssh-agent protocol to convey this information.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent GETEVENTCOUNTER,  Next: Agent GETINFO,  Prev: Agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.15 Get the Event Counters
-----------------------------

       GETEVENTCOUNTER

   This function return one status line with the current values of the
event counters.  The event counters are useful to avoid polling by
delaying a poll until something has changed.  The values are decimal
numbers in the range ‘0’ to ‘UINT_MAX’ and wrapping around to 0.  The
actual values should not be relied upon; they shall only be used to
detect a change.

   The currently defined counters are:
‘ANY’
     Incremented with any change of any of the other counters.
‘KEY’
     Incremented for added or removed private keys.
‘CARD’
     Incremented for each change of the card reader&#39;s status.

2.6.16 Return information about the process
-------------------------------------------

This is a multipurpose function to return a variety of information.

     GETINFO WHAT

   The value of WHAT specifies the kind of information returned:
‘version’
     Return the version of the program.
‘pid’
     Return the process id of the process.
‘socket_name’
     Return the name of the socket used to connect the agent.
‘ssh_socket_name’
     Return the name of the socket used for SSH connections.  If SSH
     support has not been enabled the error ‘GPG_ERR_NO_DATA’ will be
     returned.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Agent OPTION,  Prev: Agent GETINFO,  Up: Agent Protocol

2.6.17 Set options for the session
----------------------------------

Here is a list of session options which are not yet described with other
commands.  The general syntax for an Assuan option is:

     OPTION  KEY=VALUE

Supported KEYs are:

‘agent-awareness’
     This may be used to tell gpg-agent of which gpg-agent version the
     client is aware of.  gpg-agent uses this information to enable
     features which might break older clients.

‘putenv’
     Change the session&#39;s environment to be used for the Pinentry.
     Valid values are:

     ‘NAME’
          Delete envvar NAME
     ‘NAME=’
          Set envvar NAME to the empty string
     ‘NAME=VALUE’
          Set envvar NAME to the string VALUE.

‘use-cache-for-signing’
     See Assuan command ‘PKSIGN’.

‘allow-pinentry-notify’
     This does not need any value.  It is used to enable the
     PINENTRY_LAUNCHED inquiry.

‘pinentry-mode’
     This option is used to change the operation mode of the pinentry.
     The following values are defined:

     ‘ask’
          This is the default mode which pops up a pinentry as needed.

     ‘cancel’
          Instead of popping up a pinentry, return the error code
          ‘GPG_ERR_CANCELED’.

     ‘error’
          Instead of popping up a pinentry, return the error code
          ‘GPG_ERR_NO_PIN_ENTRY’.

     ‘loopback’
          Use a loopback pinentry.  This fakes a pinentry by using
          inquiries back to the caller to ask for a passphrase.  This
          option may only be set if the agent has been configured for
          that.  To disable this feature use *note option
          --no-allow-loopback-pinentry::.

‘cache-ttl-opt-preset’
     This option sets the cache TTL for new entries created by GENKEY
     and PASSWD commands when using the ‘--preset’ option.  It is not
     used a default value is used.

‘s2k-count’
     Instead of using the standard S2K count (which is computed on the
     fly), the given S2K count is used for new keys or when changing the
     passphrase of a key.  Values below 65536 are considered to be 0.
     This option is valid for the entire session or until reset to 0.
     This option is useful if the key is later used on boxes which are
     either much slower or faster than the actual box.

‘pretend-request-origin’
     This option switches the connection into a restricted mode which
     handles all further commands in the same way as they would be
     handled when originating from the extra or browser socket.  Note
     that this option is not available in the restricted mode.  Valid
     values for this option are:

     ‘none’
     ‘local’
          This is a NOP and leaves the connection in the standard way.

     ‘remote’
          Pretend to come from a remote origin in the same way as
          connections from the ‘--extra-socket’.

     ‘browser’
          Pretend to come from a local web browser in the same way as
          connections from the ‘--browser-socket’.

3 Invoking DIRMNGR
******************

Since version 2.1 of GnuPG, ‘dirmngr’ takes care of accessing the
OpenPGP keyservers.  As with previous versions it is also used as a
server for managing and downloading certificate revocation lists (CRLs)
for X.509 certificates, downloading X.509 certificates, and providing
access to OCSP providers.  Dirmngr is invoked internally by ‘gpg’,
‘gpgsm’, or via the ‘gpg-connect-agent’ tool.

3.1 Commands
============

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

‘--version’
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--help, -h’
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--dump-options’
     Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--server’
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the ‘stdin’.  The
     default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.
     This is only used for testing.

‘--daemon’
     Run in background daemon mode and listen for commands on a socket.
     This is the way ‘dirmngr’ is started on demand by the other GnuPG
     components.  To force starting ‘dirmngr’ it is in general best to
     use ‘gpgconf --launch dirmngr’.

‘--supervised’
     Run in the foreground, sending logs to stderr, and listening on
     file descriptor 3, which must already be bound to a listening
     socket.  This option is deprecated and not supported on Windows.

‘--list-crls’
     List the contents of the CRL cache on ‘stdout’.  This is probably
     only useful for debugging purposes.

‘--load-crl FILE’
     This command requires a filename as additional argument, and it
     will make Dirmngr try to import the CRL in FILE into it&#39;s cache.
     Note, that this is only possible if Dirmngr is able to retrieve the
     CA&#39;s certificate directly by its own means.  In general it is
     better to use ‘gpgsm’&#39;s ‘--call-dirmngr loadcrl filename’ command
     so that ‘gpgsm’ can help dirmngr.

‘--fetch-crl URL’
     This command requires an URL as additional argument, and it will
     make dirmngr try to retrieve and import the CRL from that URL into
     it&#39;s cache.  This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.  The
     ‘dirmngr-client’ provides the same feature for a running dirmngr.

‘--shutdown’
     This commands shuts down an running instance of Dirmngr.  This
     command has currently no effect.

‘--flush’
     This command removes all CRLs from Dirmngr&#39;s cache.  Client
     requests will thus trigger reading of fresh CRLs.

3.2 Option Summary
==================

Note that all long options with the exception of ‘--options’ and
‘--homedir’ may also be given in the configuration file after stripping
off the two leading dashes.

‘--options FILE’
     Reads configuration from FILE instead of from the default per-user
     configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
     ‘dirmngr.conf’ and expected in the home directory.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  This option is only
     effective when used on the command line.  The default is the
     directory named ‘.gnupg’ directly below the home directory of the
     user unless the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’ has been set in
     which case its value will be used.  Many kinds of data are stored
     within this directory.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to DIRMNGR, such as
     ‘-vv’.

‘--log-file FILE’
     Append all logging output to FILE.  This is very helpful in seeing
     what the agent actually does.  Use ‘socket://’ to log to socket.

‘--compatibility-flags FLAGS’
     Set compatibility flags to work around certain problems or to
     emulate bugs.  The FLAGS are given as a comma separated list of
     flag names and are OR-ed together.  The special flag &quot;none&quot; clears
     the list and allows one to start over with an empty list.  To get a
     list of available flags the sole word &quot;help&quot; can be used.

‘--faked-system-time EPOCH’
     This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time
     back or forth to EPOCH which is the number of seconds elapsed since
     the year 1970.  Alternatively EPOCH may be given as a full ISO time
     string (e.g.  &quot;20070924T154812&quot;).

‘--debug-level LEVEL’
     Select the debug level for investigating problems.  LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or by a keyword:

     ‘none’
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of the keyword.
     ‘basic’
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘advanced’
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘expert’
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘guru’
          All of the debug messages you can get.  A value greater than 8
          may be used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program.  They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

‘--debug FLAGS’
     Set debug flags.  All flags are or-ed and FLAGS may be given in C
     syntax (e.g.  0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.
     To get a list of all supported flags the single word &quot;help&quot; can be
     used.  This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior
     may change at any time without notice.

‘--debug-all’
     Same as ‘--debug=0xffffffff’

‘--tls-debug LEVEL’
     Enable debugging of the TLS layer at LEVEL.  The details of the
     debug level depend on the used TLS library and are not set in
     stone.

‘--debug-wait N’
     When running in server mode, wait N seconds before entering the
     actual processing loop and print the pid.  This gives time to
     attach a debugger.

‘--disable-check-own-socket’
     On some platforms ‘dirmngr’ is able to detect the removal of its
     socket file and shutdown itself.  This option disable this
     self-test for debugging purposes.

‘-s’
‘--sh’
‘-c’
‘--csh’
     Format the info output in daemon mode for use with the standard
     Bourne shell respective the C-shell.  The default is to guess it
     based on the environment variable ‘SHELL’ which is in almost all
     cases sufficient.

‘--force’
     Enabling this option forces loading of expired CRLs; this is only
     useful for debugging.

‘--use-tor’
‘--no-use-tor’
     The option ‘--use-tor’ switches Dirmngr and thus GnuPG into &quot;Tor
     mode&quot; to route all network access via Tor (an anonymity network).
     Certain other features are disabled in this mode.  The effect of
     ‘--use-tor’ cannot be overridden by any other command or even by
     reloading dirmngr.  The use of ‘--no-use-tor’ disables the use of
     Tor.  The default is to use Tor if it is available on startup or
     after reloading dirmngr.  The test on the availability of Tor is
     done by trying to connect to a SOCKS proxy at either port 9050 or
     9150; if another type of proxy is listening on one of these ports,
     you should use ‘--no-use-tor’.

‘--standard-resolver’
     This option forces the use of the system&#39;s standard DNS resolver
     code.  This is mainly used for debugging.  Note that on Windows a
     standard resolver is not used and all DNS access will return the
     error &quot;Not Implemented&quot; if this option is used.  Using this
     together with enabled Tor mode returns the error &quot;Not Enabled&quot;.

‘--recursive-resolver’
     When possible use a recursive resolver instead of a stub resolver.

‘--resolver-timeout N’
     Set the timeout for the DNS resolver to N seconds.  The default are
     30 seconds.

‘--connect-timeout N’
‘--connect-quick-timeout N’
     Set the timeout for HTTP and generic TCP connection attempts to N
     seconds.  The value set with the quick variant is used when the
     -quick option has been given to certain Assuan commands.  The quick
     value is capped at the value of the regular connect timeout.  The
     default values are 15 and 2 seconds.  Note that the timeout values
     are for each connection attempt; the connection code will attempt
     to connect all addresses listed for a server.

‘--listen-backlog N’
     Set the size of the queue for pending connections.  The default is
     64.

‘--allow-version-check’
     Allow Dirmngr to connect to ‘https://versions.gnupg.org’ to get the
     list of current software versions.  On debian-packaged versions,
     this option does nothing since software updates should be handled
     by the distribution.  See the option ‘--query-swdb’ of the command
     ‘gpgconf’ for more details.  Note, that regardless of this option a
     version check can always be triggered using this command:

                 gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr &#39;loadswdb --force&#39; /bye

‘--keyserver NAME’
     Use NAME as your keyserver.  This is the server that ‘gpg’
     communicates with to receive keys, send keys, and search for keys.
     The format of the NAME is a URI: &#39;scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]&#39;
     The scheme is the type of keyserver: &quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or
     compatible) keyservers or &quot;ldap&quot; for the LDAP keyservers.  Note
     that your particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver
     types available as well.  Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive.
     After the keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options
     may be provided.  These are the same as the ‘--keyserver-options’
     of ‘gpg’, but apply only to this particular keyserver.

     Some keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is not always
     a need to send keys to more than one server.  Some keyservers use
     round robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use it.

     If exactly two keyservers are configured and only one is a Tor
     hidden service (.onion), Dirmngr selects the keyserver to use
     depending on whether Tor is locally running or not.  The check for
     a running Tor is done for each new connection.

     If no keyserver is explicitly configured, dirmngr will use the
     built-in default of ‘hkps://keys.openpgp.org’.  To avoid the use of
     a default keyserver the value ‘none’ can be used.

     Note that the above default is a Debian-specific choice.  Upstream
     GnuPG prefers ‘hkps://keys.openpgp.org’.  See
     /usr/share/doc/gpgconf/NEWS.Debian.gz for more details.

     Windows users with a keyserver running on their Active Directory
     may use the short form ‘ldap:///’ for NAME to access this
     directory.

     For accessing anonymous LDAP keyservers NAME is in general just a
     ‘ldaps://ldap.example.com’.  A BaseDN parameter should never be
     specified.  If authentication is required things are more
     complicated and two methods are available:

     The modern method (since version 2.2.28) is to use the very same
     syntax as used with the option ‘--ldapserver’.  Please see over
     there for details; here is an example:

                 keyserver ldap:ldap.example.com::uid=USERNAME,ou=GnuPG Users,
                 dc=example,dc=com:PASSWORD::starttls

     The other method is to use a full URL for NAME; for example:

                 keyserver ldaps://ldap.example.com/????bindname=uid=USERNAME
                 %2Cou=GnuPG%20Users%2Cdc=example%2Cdc=com,password=PASSWORD

     Put this all on one line without any spaces and keep the &#39;%2C&#39; as
     given.  Replace USERNAME, PASSWORD, and the &#39;dc&#39; parts according to
     the instructions received from your LDAP administrator.  Note that
     only simple authentication (i.e.  cleartext passwords) is supported
     and thus using ldaps is strongly suggested (since 2.2.28 &quot;ldaps&quot;
     defaults to port 389 and uses STARTTLS). On Windows authentication
     via AD can be requested by adding ‘gpgNtds=1’ after the fourth
     question mark instead of the bindname and password parameter.

‘--nameserver IPADDR’
     In &quot;Tor mode&quot; Dirmngr uses a public resolver via Tor to resolve DNS
     names.  If the default public resolver, which is ‘8.8.8.8’, shall
     not be used a different one can be given using this option.  Note
     that a numerical IP address must be given (IPv6 or IPv4) and that
     no error checking is done for IPADDR.

‘--disable-ipv4’
‘--disable-ipv6’
     Disable the use of all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

‘--disable-ldap’
     Entirely disables the use of LDAP.

‘--disable-http’
     Entirely disables the use of HTTP.

‘--ignore-http-dp’
     When looking for the location of a CRL, the to be tested
     certificate usually contains so called “CRL Distribution Point”
     (DP) entries which are URLs describing the way to access the CRL.
     The first found DP entry is used.  With this option all entries
     using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.

‘--ignore-ldap-dp’
     This is similar to ‘--ignore-http-dp’ but ignores entries using the
     LDAP scheme.  Both options may be combined resulting in ignoring
     DPs entirely.

‘--ignore-ocsp-service-url’
     Ignore all OCSP URLs contained in the certificate.  The effect is
     to force the use of the default responder.

‘--honor-http-proxy’
     If the environment variable ‘http_proxy’ has been set, use its
     value to access HTTP servers.  If on Windows the option is used but
     the environment variable is not set, the proxy settings are taken
     from the system.

‘--http-proxy HOST[:PORT]’
     Use HOST and PORT to access HTTP servers.  The use of this option
     overrides the environment variable ‘http_proxy’ regardless whether
     ‘--honor-http-proxy’ has been set.

‘--ldap-proxy HOST[:PORT]’
     Use HOST and PORT to connect to LDAP servers.  If PORT is omitted,
     port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.  This overrides any
     specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if
     host and port have been omitted from the URL.

‘--only-ldap-proxy’
     Never use anything else but the LDAP &quot;proxy&quot; as configured with
     ‘--ldap-proxy’.  Usually ‘dirmngr’ tries to use other configured
     LDAP server if the connection using the &quot;proxy&quot; failed.

‘--ldapserverlist-file FILE’
     Read the list of LDAP servers to consult for CRLs and X.509
     certificates from file instead of the default per-user ldap server
     list file.  The default value for FILE is
     ‘dirmngr_ldapservers.conf’.

     This server list file contains one LDAP server per line in the
     format

     HOSTNAME:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD:BASE_DN:FLAGS

     Lines starting with a ‘#’ are comments.

     Note that as usual all strings entered are expected to be UTF-8
     encoded.  Obviously this will lead to problems if the password has
     originally been encoded as Latin-1.  There is no other solution
     here than to put such a password in the binary encoding into the
     file (i.e.  non-ascii characters won&#39;t show up readable).(1)

‘--ldapserver SPEC’
     This is an alternative way to specify LDAP servers for CRL and
     X.509 certificate retrieval.  If this option is used the servers
     configured in ‘dirmngr_ldapservers.conf’ (or the file given by
     ‘--ldapserverlist-file’) are cleared.  Note that
     ‘dirmngr_ldapservers.conf’ is not read again by a reload signal.
     However, ‘--ldapserver’ options are read again.

     SPEC is either a proper LDAP URL or a colon delimited list of the
     form

     HOSTNAME:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD:BASE_DN:FLAGS:

     with an optional prefix of ‘ldap:’ (but without the two slashes
     which would turn this into a proper LDAP URL). FLAGS is a list of
     one or more comma delimited keywords:
     ‘plain’
          The default: Do not use a TLS secured connection at all; the
          default port is 389.
     ‘starttls’
          Use STARTTLS to secure the connection; the default port is
          389.
     ‘ldaptls’
          Tunnel LDAP through a TLS connection; the default port is 636.
     ‘ntds’
          On Windows authenticate the LDAP connection using the Active
          Directory with the current user.
     ‘areconly’
          On Windows use only the A or AAAA record when resolving the
          LDAP server name.

     Note that in an URL style specification the scheme ‘ldaps://’
     refers to STARTTLS and _not_ to LDAP-over-TLS.

‘--ldaptimeout SECS’
     Specify the number of seconds to wait for an LDAP query before
     timing out.  The default are 15 seconds.  0 will never timeout.

‘--add-servers’
     This option makes dirmngr add any servers it discovers when
     validating certificates against CRLs to the internal list of
     servers to consult for certificates and CRLs.  This option should
     in general not be used.

     This option might be useful when trying to validate a certificate
     that has a CRL distribution point that points to a server that is
     not already listed in the ldapserverlist.  Dirmngr will always go
     to this server and try to download the CRL, but chances are high
     that the certificate used to sign the CRL is located on the same
     server.  So if dirmngr doesn&#39;t add that new server to list, it will
     often not be able to verify the signature of the CRL unless the
     ‘--add-servers’ option is used.

     Caveat emptor: Using this option may enable denial-of-service
     attacks and leak search requests to unknown third parties.  This is
     because arbitrary servers are added to the internal list of LDAP
     servers which in turn is used for all unspecific LDAP queries as
     well as a fallback for queries which did not return a result.

‘--allow-ocsp’
     This option enables OCSP support if requested by the client.

     OCSP requests are rejected by default because they may violate the
     privacy of the user; for example it is possible to track the time
     when a user is reading a mail.

‘--ocsp-responder URL’
     Use URL as the default OCSP Responder if the certificate does not
     contain information about an assigned responder.  Note, that
     ‘--ocsp-signer’ must also be set to a valid certificate.

‘--ocsp-signer FPR|FILE’
     Use the certificate with the fingerprint FPR to check the responses
     of the default OCSP Responder.  Alternatively a filename can be
     given in which case the response is expected to be signed by one of
     the certificates described in that file.  Any argument which
     contains a slash, dot or tilde is considered a filename.  Usual
     filename expansion takes place: A tilde at the start followed by a
     slash is replaced by the content of ‘HOME’, no slash at start
     describes a relative filename which will be searched at the home
     directory.  To make sure that the FILE is searched in the home
     directory, either prepend the name with &quot;./&quot; or use a name which
     contains a dot.

     If a response has been signed by a certificate described by these
     fingerprints no further check upon the validity of this certificate
     is done.

     The format of the FILE is a list of SHA-1 fingerprint, one per line
     with optional colons between the bytes.  Empty lines and lines
     prefix with a hash mark are ignored.

‘--ocsp-max-clock-skew N’
     The number of seconds a skew between the OCSP responder and them
     local clock is accepted.  Default is 600 (10 minutes).

‘--ocsp-max-period N’
     Seconds a response is at maximum considered valid after the time
     given in the thisUpdate field.  Default is 7776000 (90 days).

‘--ocsp-current-period N’
     The number of seconds an OCSP response is considered valid after
     the time given in the NEXT_UPDATE datum.  Default is 10800 (3
     hours).

‘--max-replies N’
     Do not return more that N items in one query.  The default is 10.

‘--ignore-cert-extension OID’
     Add OID to the list of ignored certificate extensions.  The OID is
     expected to be in dotted decimal form, like ‘2.5.29.3’.  This
     option may be used more than once.  Critical flagged certificate
     extensions matching one of the OIDs in the list are treated as if
     they are actually handled and thus the certificate won&#39;t be
     rejected due to an unknown critical extension.  Use this option
     with care because extensions are usually flagged as critical for a
     reason.

‘--ignore-crl-extension OID’
     Add OID to the list of ignored CRL extensions.  The OID is expected
     to be in dotted decimal form.  Critical flagged CRL extensions
     matching one of the OIDs in the list are treated as if they are
     actually handled and thus the certificate won&#39;t be rejected due to
     an unknown critical extension.  Use this option with care because
     extensions are usually flagged as critical for a reason.

‘--ignore-cert FPR|FILE’
     Entirely ignore certificates with the fingerprint FPR.  As an
     alternative to the fingerprint a filename can be given in which
     case all certificates described in that file are ignored.  Any
     argument which contains a slash, dot or tilde is considered a
     filename.  Usual filename expansion takes place: A tilde at the
     start followed by a slash is replaced by the content of ‘HOME’, no
     slash at start describes a relative filename which will be searched
     at the home directory.  To make sure that the FILE is searched in
     the home directory, either prepend the name with &quot;./&quot; or use a name
     which contains a dot.  The format of such a file is a list of SHA-1
     fingerprint, one per line with optional colons between the bytes.
     Empty lines and lines prefixed with a hash mark are ignored.

     This option is useful as a quick workaround to exclude certain
     certificates from the system store.

‘--hkp-cacert FILE’
     Use the root certificates in FILE for verification of the TLS
     certificates used with ‘hkps’ (keyserver access over TLS). If the
     file is in PEM format a suffix of ‘.pem’ is expected for FILE.
     This option may be given multiple times to add more root
     certificates.  Tilde expansion is supported.

     If no ‘hkp-cacert’ directive is present, dirmngr will use the
     system CAs.

3.3 Configuration
=================

Dirmngr makes use of several directories when running in daemon mode:
There are a few configuration files to control the operation of dirmngr.
By default they may all be found in the current home directory (*note
option --homedir::).

‘dirmngr.conf’
     This is the standard configuration file read by ‘dirmngr’ on
     startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two
     dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
     This file is also read after a ‘SIGHUP’ however not all options
     will actually have an effect.  This default name may be changed on
     the command line (*note option --options::).  You should backup
     this file.

‘/etc/gnupg/trusted-certs’
     This directory should be filled with certificates of Root CAs you
     are trusting in checking the CRLs and signing OCSP Responses.

     Usually these are the same certificates you use with the
     applications making use of dirmngr.  It is expected that each of
     these certificate files contain exactly one DER encoded certificate
     in a file with the suffix ‘.crt’ or ‘.der’.  ‘dirmngr’ reads those
     certificates on startup and when given a SIGHUP. Certificates which
     are not readable or do not make up a proper X.509 certificate are
     ignored; see the log file for details.

     Applications using dirmngr (e.g.  gpgsm) can request these
     certificates to complete a trust chain in the same way as with the
     extra-certs directory (see below).

     Note that for OCSP responses the certificate specified using the
     option ‘--ocsp-signer’ is always considered valid to sign OCSP
     requests.

‘/etc/gnupg/extra-certs’
     This directory may contain extra certificates which are preloaded
     into the internal cache on startup.  Applications using dirmngr
     (e.g.  gpgsm) can request cached certificates to complete a trust
     chain.  This is convenient in cases you have a couple intermediate
     CA certificates or certificates usually used to sign OCSP
     responses.  These certificates are first tried before going out to
     the net to look for them.  These certificates must also be DER
     encoded and suffixed with ‘.crt’ or ‘.der’.

‘~/.gnupg/crls.d’
     This directory is used to store cached CRLs.  The ‘crls.d’ part
     will be created by dirmngr if it does not exists but you need to
     make sure that the upper directory exists.

   Several options control the use of trusted certificates for TLS and
CRLs.  Here is an Overview on the use and origin of those Root CA
certificates:

System

     These System root certificates are used by: FIXME

     The origin of the system provided certificates depends on the
     platform.  On Windows all certificates from the Windows System
     Stores ‘ROOT’ and ‘CA’ are used.

     On other platforms the certificates are read from the first file
     found form this list: ‘/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem’,
     ‘/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt’, ‘/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem’,
     ‘/usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt’, ‘/etc/ssl/cert.pem’.

GnuPG

     The GnuPG specific certificates stored in the directory
     ‘/etc/gnupg/trusted-certs’ are only used to validate CRLs.

OpenPGP keyserver

     For accessing the OpenPGP keyservers the only certificates used are
     those set with the configuration option ‘hkp-cacert’.

OpenPGP keyserver pool

     This is usually only one certificate read from the file
     ‘/usr/share/gnupg/gnupg/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem’.  If this
     certificate exists it is used to access the special keyservers
     ‘hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net’ (or ‘hkps://keys.gnupg.net’).

   Please note that ‘gpgsm’ accepts Root CA certificates for its own
purposes only if they are listed in its file ‘trustlist.txt’.  ‘dirmngr’
does not make use of this list - except FIXME.

   To be able to see diagnostics it is often useful to put at least the
following lines into the configuration file ‘~/gnupg/dirmngr.conf’:

     log-file ~/dirmngr.log
     verbose

   You may want to check the log file to see whether all desired root CA
certificates are correctly loaded.

   To be able to perform OCSP requests you probably want to add the
line:

     allow-ocsp

   To make sure that new options are read or that after the installation
of a new GnuPG versions the right dirmngr version is running, you should
kill an existing dirmngr so that a new instance is started as needed by
the other components:

     gpgconf --kill dirmngr

   Direct interfaction with the dirmngr is possible by using the command

     gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr

   Enter ‘HELP’ at the prompt to see a list of commands and enter ‘HELP’
followed by a command name to get help on that command.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Dirmngr Signals,  Next: Dirmngr Examples,  Prev: Dirmngr Configuration,  Up: Invoking DIRMNGR

3.4 Use of signals
==================

A running ‘dirmngr’ may be controlled by signals, i.e.  using the ‘kill’
command to send a signal to the process.

   Here is a list of supported signals:

‘SIGHUP’
     This signal flushes all internally cached CRLs as well as any
     cached certificates.  Then the certificate cache is reinitialized
     as on startup.  Options are re-read from the configuration file.
     Instead of sending this signal it is better to use
          gpgconf --reload dirmngr

‘SIGTERM’
     Shuts down the process but waits until all current requests are
     fulfilled.  If the process has received 3 of these signals and
     requests are still pending, a shutdown is forced.  You may also use
          gpgconf --kill dirmngr
     instead of this signal

‘SIGINT’
     Shuts down the process immediately.

‘SIGUSR1’
     This prints some caching statistics to the log file.

3.5 Examples
============

Here is an example on how to show dirmngr&#39;s internal table of OpenPGP
keyserver addresses.  The output is intended for debugging purposes and
not part of a defined API.

       gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr &#39;keyserver --hosttable&#39; /bye

   To inhibit the use of a particular host you have noticed in one of
the keyserver pools, you may use

      gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr &#39;keyserver --dead pgpkeys.bnd.de&#39; /bye

   The description of the ‘keyserver’ command can be printed using

      gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr &#39;help keyserver&#39; /bye

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Dirmngr Protocol,  Prev: Dirmngr Examples,  Up: Invoking DIRMNGR

3.6 Dirmngr&#39;s Assuan Protocol
=============================

Assuan is the IPC protocol used to access dirmngr.  This is a
description of the commands implemented by dirmngr.

* Menu:

* Dirmngr LOOKUP::      Look up a certificate via LDAP
* Dirmngr ISVALID::     Validate a certificate using a CRL or OCSP.
* Dirmngr CHECKCRL::    Validate a certificate using a CRL.
* Dirmngr CHECKOCSP::   Validate a certificate using OCSP.
* Dirmngr CACHECERT::   Put a certificate into the internal cache.
* Dirmngr VALIDATE::    Validate a certificate for debugging.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Dirmngr LOOKUP,  Next: Dirmngr ISVALID,  Up: Dirmngr Protocol

3.6.1 Return the certificate(s) found
-------------------------------------

Lookup certificate.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed) quoting
is required: Spaces are to be translated into &quot;+&quot; or into &quot;%20&quot;;
obviously this requires that the usual escape quoting rules are applied.
The server responds with:

       S: D &lt;DER encoded certificate&gt;
       S: END
       S: D &lt;second DER encoded certificate&gt;
       S: END
       S: OK

   In this example 2 certificates are returned.  The server may return
any number of certificates; OK will also be returned when no
certificates were found.  The dirmngr might return a status line

       S: S TRUNCATED &lt;n&gt;

   To indicate that the output was truncated to N items due to a
limitation of the server or by an arbitrary set limit.

   The option ‘--url’ may be used if instead of a search pattern a
complete URL to the certificate is known:

       C: LOOKUP --url CN%3DWerner%20Koch,o%3DIntevation%20GmbH,c%3DDE?userCertificate

   If the option ‘--cache-only’ is given, no external lookup is done so
that only certificates from the cache are returned.

   With the option ‘--single’, the first and only the first match will
be returned.  Unless option ‘--cache-only’ is also used, no local lookup
will be done in this case.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Dirmngr ISVALID,  Next: Dirmngr CHECKCRL,  Prev: Dirmngr LOOKUP,  Up: Dirmngr Protocol

3.6.2 Validate a certificate using a CRL or OCSP
------------------------------------------------

       ISVALID [--only-ocsp] [--force-default-responder] CERTID|CERTFPR

   Check whether the certificate described by the CERTID has been
revoked.  Due to caching, the Dirmngr is able to answer immediately in
most cases.

   The CERTID is a hex encoded string consisting of two parts, delimited
by a single dot.  The first part is the SHA-1 hash of the issuer name
and the second part the serial number.

   Alternatively the certificate&#39;s SHA-1 fingerprint CERTFPR may be
given in which case an OCSP request is done before consulting the CRL.
If the option ‘--only-ocsp’ is given, no fallback to a CRL check will be
used.  If the option ‘--force-default-responder’ is given, only the
default OCSP responder will be used and any other methods of obtaining
an OCSP responder URL won&#39;t be used.

Common return values are:

‘GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR (0)’
     This is the positive answer: The certificate is not revoked and we
     have an up-to-date revocation list for that certificate.  If OCSP
     was used the responder confirmed that the certificate has not been
     revoked.

‘GPG_ERR_CERT_REVOKED’
     This is the negative answer: The certificate has been revoked.
     Either it is in a CRL and that list is up to date or an OCSP
     responder informed us that it has been revoked.

‘GPG_ERR_NO_CRL_KNOWN’
     No CRL is known for this certificate or the CRL is not valid or out
     of date.

‘GPG_ERR_NO_DATA’
     The OCSP responder returned an &quot;unknown&quot; status.  This means that
     it is not aware of the certificate&#39;s status.

‘GPG_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED’
     This is commonly seen if OCSP support has not been enabled in the
     configuration.

   If DirMngr has not enough information about the given certificate
(which is the case for not yet cached certificates), it will inquire the
missing data:

       S: INQUIRE SENDCERT &lt;CertID&gt;
       C: D &lt;DER encoded certificate&gt;
       C: END

   A client should be aware that DirMngr may ask for more than one
certificate.

   If Dirmngr has a certificate but the signature of the certificate
could not been validated because the root certificate is not known to
dirmngr as trusted, it may ask back to see whether the client trusts
this the root certificate:

       S: INQUIRE ISTRUSTED &lt;CertHexfpr&gt;
       C: D 1
       C: END

   Only this answer will let Dirmngr consider the certificate as valid.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Dirmngr CHECKCRL,  Next: Dirmngr CHECKOCSP,  Prev: Dirmngr ISVALID,  Up: Dirmngr Protocol

3.6.3 Validate a certificate using a CRL
----------------------------------------

Check whether the certificate with FINGERPRINT (SHA-1 hash of the entire
X.509 certificate blob) is valid or not by consulting the CRL
responsible for this certificate.  If the fingerprint has not been given
or the certificate is not known, the function inquires the certificate
using:

       S: INQUIRE TARGETCERT
       C: D &lt;DER encoded certificate&gt;
       C: END

   Thus the caller is expected to return the certificate for the request
(which should match FINGERPRINT) as a binary blob.  Processing then
takes place without further interaction; in particular dirmngr tries to
locate other required certificate by its own mechanism which includes a
local certificate store as well as a list of trusted root certificates.

The return code is 0 for success; i.e.  the certificate has not been
revoked or one of the usual error codes from libgpg-error.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Dirmngr CHECKOCSP,  Next: Dirmngr CACHECERT,  Prev: Dirmngr CHECKCRL,  Up: Dirmngr Protocol

3.6.4 Validate a certificate using OCSP
---------------------------------------

       CHECKOCSP [--force-default-responder] [FINGERPRINT]

   Check whether the certificate with FINGERPRINT (the SHA-1 hash of the
entire X.509 certificate blob) is valid by consulting the appropriate
OCSP responder.  If the fingerprint has not been given or the
certificate is not known by Dirmngr, the function inquires the
certificate using:

       S: INQUIRE TARGETCERT
       C: D &lt;DER encoded certificate&gt;
       C: END

   Thus the caller is expected to return the certificate for the request
(which should match FINGERPRINT) as a binary blob.  Processing then
takes place without further interaction; in particular dirmngr tries to
locate other required certificates by its own mechanism which includes a
local certificate store as well as a list of trusted root certificates.

   If the option ‘--force-default-responder’ is given, only the default
OCSP responder is used.  This option is the per-command variant of the
global option ‘--ignore-ocsp-service-url’.

The return code is 0 for success; i.e.  the certificate has not been
revoked or one of the usual error codes from libgpg-error.

3.6.5 Put a certificate into the internal cache
-----------------------------------------------

Put a certificate into the internal cache.  This command might be useful
if a client knows in advance certificates required for a test and wants
to make sure they get added to the internal cache.  It is also helpful
for debugging.  To get the actual certificate, this command immediately
inquires it using

       S: INQUIRE TARGETCERT
       C: D &lt;DER encoded certificate&gt;
       C: END

   Thus the caller is expected to return the certificate for the request
as a binary blob.

The return code is 0 for success; i.e.  the certificate has not been
successfully cached or one of the usual error codes from libgpg-error.

3.6.6 Validate a certificate for debugging
------------------------------------------

Validate a certificate using the certificate validation function used
internally by dirmngr.  This command is only useful for debugging.  To
get the actual certificate, this command immediately inquires it using

       S: INQUIRE TARGETCERT
       C: D &lt;DER encoded certificate&gt;
       C: END

   Thus the caller is expected to return the certificate for the request
as a binary blob.

4 Invoking GPG
**************

‘gpg’ is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool
to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP
standard.  ‘gpg’ features complete key management and all the bells and
whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP implementation.

   There are two main versions of GnuPG: GnuPG 1.x and GnuPG 2.x.  GnuPG
2.x supports modern encryption algorithms and thus should be preferred
over GnuPG 1.x.  You only need to use GnuPG 1.x if your platform doesn&#39;t
support GnuPG 2.x, or you need support for some features that GnuPG 2.x
has deprecated, e.g., decrypting data created with PGP-2 keys.

   If you are looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version
installed under the name ‘gpg1’.

4.1 Commands
============

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.  Generally speaking, irrelevant options are
silently ignored, and may not be checked for correctness.

   ‘gpg’ may be run with no commands.  In this case it will print a
warning perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is
given as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is
verified, a file containing keys is listed, etc.).

   If you run into any problems, please add the option ‘--verbose’ to
the invocation to see more diagnostics.

4.1.2 Commands to select the type of operation
----------------------------------------------

‘--sign’
‘-s’
     Sign a message.  This command may be combined with ‘--encrypt’ (to
     sign and encrypt a message), ‘--symmetric’ (to sign and
     symmetrically encrypt a message), or both ‘--encrypt’ and
     ‘--symmetric’ (to sign and encrypt a message that can be decrypted
     using a secret key or a passphrase).  The signing key is chosen by
     default or can be set explicitly using the ‘--local-user’ and
     ‘--default-key’ options.

‘--clear-sign’
‘--clearsign’
     Make a cleartext signature.  The content in a cleartext signature
     is readable without any special software.  OpenPGP software is only
     needed to verify the signature.  cleartext signatures may modify
     end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not
     intended to be reversible.  The signing key is chosen by default or
     can be set explicitly using the ‘--local-user’ and ‘--default-key’
     options.

‘--detach-sign’
‘-b’
     Make a detached signature.

‘--encrypt’
‘-e’
     Encrypt data to one or more public keys.  This command may be
     combined with ‘--sign’ (to sign and encrypt a message),
     ‘--symmetric’ (to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a
     secret key or a passphrase), or ‘--sign’ and ‘--symmetric’ together
     (for a signed message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a
     passphrase).  ‘--recipient’ and related options specify which
     public keys to use for encryption.

‘--symmetric’
‘-c’
     Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  The default
     symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the
     ‘--cipher-algo’ option.  This command may be combined with ‘--sign’
     (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), ‘--encrypt’
     (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
     passphrase), or ‘--sign’ and ‘--encrypt’ together (for a signed
     message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).
     ‘gpg’ caches the passphrase used for symmetric encryption so that a
     decrypt operation may not require that the user needs to enter the
     passphrase.  The option ‘--no-symkey-cache’ can be used to disable
     this feature.

‘--store’
     Store only (make a simple literal data packet).

‘--decrypt’
‘-d’
     Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is
     specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with
     ‘--output’).  If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is
     also verified.  This command differs from the default operation, as
     it never writes to the filename which is included in the file and
     it rejects files that don&#39;t begin with an encrypted message.

‘--verify’
     Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it
     without generating any output.  With no arguments, the signature
     packet is read from STDIN. If only one argument is given, the
     specified file is expected to include a complete signature.

     With more than one argument, the first argument should specify a
     file with a detached signature and the remaining files should
     contain the signed data.  To read the signed data from STDIN, use
     ‘-’ as the second filename.  For security reasons, a detached
     signature will not read the signed material from STDIN if not
     explicitly specified.

     Note: If the option ‘--batch’ is not used, ‘gpg’ may assume that a
     single argument is a file with a detached signature, and it will
     try to find a matching data file by stripping certain suffixes.
     Using this historical feature to verify a detached signature is
     strongly discouraged; you should always specify the data file
     explicitly.

     Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, ‘gpg’ verifies only
     what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra data
     outside of the cleartext signature or the header lines directly
     following the dash marker line.  The option ‘--output’ may be used
     to write out the actual signed data, but there are other pitfalls
     with this format as well.  It is suggested to avoid cleartext
     signatures in favor of detached signatures.

     Note: To check whether a file was signed by a certain key the
     option ‘--assert-signer’ can be used.  As an alternative the ‘gpgv’
     tool can be used.  ‘gpgv’ is designed to compare signed data
     against a list of trusted keys and returns with success only for a
     good signature.  It has its own manual page.

‘--multifile’
     This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for
     processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each
     filename on a separate line.  This allows for many files to be
     processed at once.  ‘--multifile’ may currently be used along with
     ‘--verify’, ‘--encrypt’, and ‘--decrypt’.  Note that ‘--multifile
     --verify’ may not be used with detached signatures.

‘--verify-files’
     Identical to ‘--multifile --verify’.

‘--encrypt-files’
     Identical to ‘--multifile --encrypt’.

‘--decrypt-files’
     Identical to ‘--multifile --decrypt’.

‘--list-keys’
‘-k’
‘--list-public-keys’
     List the specified keys.  If no keys are specified, then all keys
     from the configured public keyrings are listed.

     Never use the output of this command in scripts or other programs.
     The output is intended only for humans and its format is likely to
     change.  The ‘--with-colons’ option emits the output in a stable,
     machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by scripts and
     other programs.

‘--list-secret-keys’
‘-K’
     List the specified secret keys.  If no keys are specified, then all
     known secret keys are listed.  A ‘#’ after the initial tags ‘sec’
     or ‘ssb’ means that the secret key or subkey is currently not
     usable.  We also say that this key has been taken offline (for
     example, a primary key can be taken offline by exporting the key
     using the command ‘--export-secret-subkeys’).  A ‘&gt;’ after these
     tags indicate that the key is stored on a smartcard.  See also
     ‘--list-keys’.

‘--check-signatures’
‘--check-sigs’
     Same as ‘--list-keys’, but the key signatures are verified and
     listed too.  Note that for performance reasons the revocation
     status of a signing key is not shown.  This command has the same
     effect as using ‘--list-keys’ with ‘--with-sig-check’.

     The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly
     following the &quot;sig&quot; tag (and thus before the flags described below.
     A &quot;!&quot;  indicates that the signature has been successfully verified,
     a &quot;-&quot; denotes a bad signature and a &quot;%&quot; is used if an error
     occurred while checking the signature (e.g.  a non supported
     algorithm).  Signatures where the public key is not available are
     not listed; to see their keyids the command ‘--list-sigs’ can be
     used.

     For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the
     signature status flag and keyid.  These flags give additional
     information about each key signature.  From left to right, they are
     the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see
     ‘--ask-cert-level’), &quot;L&quot; for a local or non-exportable signature
     (see ‘--lsign-key’), &quot;R&quot; for a nonRevocable signature (see the
     ‘--edit-key’ command &quot;nrsign&quot;), &quot;P&quot; for a signature that contains a
     policy URL (see ‘--cert-policy-url’), &quot;N&quot; for a signature that
     contains a notation (see ‘--cert-notation’), &quot;X&quot; for an eXpired
     signature (see ‘--ask-cert-expire’), and the numbers 1-9 or &quot;T&quot; for
     10 and above to indicate trust signature levels (see the
     ‘--edit-key’ command &quot;tsign&quot;).

‘--locate-keys’
‘--locate-external-keys’
     Locate the keys given as arguments.  This command basically uses
     the same algorithm as used when locating keys for encryption and
     may thus be used to see what keys ‘gpg’ might use.  In particular
     external methods as defined by ‘--auto-key-locate’ are used to
     locate a key if the arguments comain valid mail addresses.  Only
     public keys are listed.

     The variant ‘--locate-external-keys’ does not consider a locally
     existing key and can thus be used to force the refresh of a key via
     the defined external methods.  If a fingerprint is given and and
     the methods defined by -auto-key-locate define LDAP servers, the
     key is fetched from these resources; defined non-LDAP keyservers
     are skipped.

‘--show-keys’
     This commands takes OpenPGP keys as input and prints information
     about them in the same way the command ‘--list-keys’ does for
     locally stored key.  In addition the list options
     ‘show-unusable-uids’, ‘show-unusable-subkeys’, ‘show-notations’ and
     ‘show-policy-urls’ are also enabled.  As usual for automated
     processing, this command should be combined with the option
     ‘--with-colons’.

‘--fingerprint’
     List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their
     fingerprints.  This is the same output as ‘--list-keys’ but with
     the additional output of a line with the fingerprint.  May also be
     combined with ‘--check-signatures’.  If this command is given
     twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too.  This
     command also forces pretty printing of fingerprints if the keyid
     format has been set to &quot;none&quot;.

‘--list-packets’
     List only the sequence of packets.  This command is only useful for
     debugging.  When used with option ‘--verbose’ the actual MPI values
     are dumped and not only their lengths.  Note that the output of
     this command may change with new releases.

‘--edit-card’
‘--card-edit’
     Present a menu to work with a smartcard.  The subcommand &quot;help&quot;
     provides an overview on available commands.  For a detailed
     description, please see the Card HOWTO at
     https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO .
     Please note that the command &quot;openpgp&quot; can be used to switch to the
     OpenPGP application of cards which by default are presenting
     another application (e.g.  PIV).

‘--card-status’
     Show the content of the smart card.

‘--change-pin’
     Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard.  This
     functionality is also available as the subcommand &quot;passwd&quot; with the
     ‘--edit-card’ command.

‘--delete-keys NAME’
     Remove key from the public keyring.  In batch mode either ‘--yes’
     is required or the key must be specified by fingerprint.  This is a
     safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys.  If the
     exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey
     only that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is used with
     the fingerprint of the primary key the entire public key is
     deleted.

‘--delete-secret-keys NAME’
     Remove key from the secret keyring.  In batch mode the key must be
     specified by fingerprint.  The option ‘--yes’ can be used to advise
     gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.  This extra pre-caution is
     done because ‘gpg’ can&#39;t be sure that the secret key (as controlled
     by gpg-agent) is only used for the given OpenPGP public key.  If
     the exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a
     subkey only the secret part of that subkey is deleted; if the
     exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key
     only the secret part of the primary key is deleted.

‘--delete-secret-and-public-key NAME’
     Same as ‘--delete-key’, but if a secret key exists, it will be
     removed first.  In batch mode the key must be specified by
     fingerprint.  The option ‘--yes’ can be used to advise gpg-agent
     not to request a confirmation.

‘--export’
     Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyring and those
     registered via option ‘--keyring’), or if at least one name is
     given, those of the given name.  The exported keys are written to
     STDOUT or to the file given with option ‘--output’.  Use together
     with ‘--armor’ to mail those keys.

‘--send-keys KEYIDS’
     Similar to ‘--export’ but sends the keys to a keyserver.
     Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs.  Don&#39;t send your
     complete keyring to a keyserver -- select only those keys which are
     new or changed by you.  If no KEYIDS are given, ‘gpg’ does nothing.

     Take care: Keyservers are by design write only systems and thus it
     is not possible to ever delete keys once they have been send to a
     keyserver.

‘--export-secret-keys’
‘--export-secret-subkeys’
     Same as ‘--export’, but exports the secret keys instead.  The
     exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with
     option ‘--output’.  This command is often used along with the
     option ‘--armor’ to allow for easy printing of the key for paper
     backup; however the external tool ‘paperkey’ does a better job of
     creating backups on paper.  Note that exporting a secret key can be
     a security risk if the exported keys are sent over an insecure
     channel.

     The second form of the command has the special property to render
     the secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension
     to OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected to
     successfully import such a key.  Its intended use is in generating
     a full key with an additional signing subkey on a dedicated
     machine.  This command then exports the key without the primary key
     to the main machine.

     GnuPG may ask you to enter the passphrase for the key.  This is
     required, because the internal protection method of the secret key
     is different from the one specified by the OpenPGP protocol.

‘--export-ssh-key’
     This command is used to export a key in the OpenSSH public key
     format.  It requires the specification of one key by the usual
     means and exports the latest valid subkey which has an
     authentication capability to STDOUT or to the file given with
     option ‘--output’.  That output can directly be added to ssh&#39;s
     ‘authorized_key’ file.

     By specifying the key to export using a key ID or a fingerprint
     suffixed with an exclamation mark (!), a specific subkey or the
     primary key can be exported.  This does not even require that the
     key has the authentication capability flag set.

‘--import’
‘--fast-import’
     Import/merge keys.  This adds the given keys to the keyring.  The
     fast version is currently just a synonym.

     There are a few other options which control how this command works.
     Most notable here is the ‘--import-options merge-only’ option which
     does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new
     signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.

‘--receive-keys KEYIDS’
‘--recv-keys KEYIDS’
     Import the keys with the given KEYIDS from a keyserver.

‘--refresh-keys’
     Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the
     local keyring.  This is useful for updating a key with the latest
     signatures, user IDs, etc.  Calling this with no arguments will
     refresh the entire keyring.

‘--search-keys NAMES’
     Search the keyserver for the given NAMES.  Multiple names given
     here will be joined together to create the search string for the
     keyserver.  Note that keyservers search for NAMES in a different
     and simpler way than gpg does.  The best choice is to use a mail
     address.  Due to data privacy reasons keyservers may even not even
     allow searching by user id or mail address and thus may only return
     results when being used with the ‘--recv-key’ command to search by
     key fingerprint or keyid.

‘--fetch-keys URIS’
     Retrieve keys located at the specified URIS.  Note that different
     installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP,
     LDAP, etc.).  When using HTTPS the system provided root
     certificates are used by this command.

‘--update-trustdb’
     Do trust database maintenance.  This command iterates over all keys
     and builds the Web of Trust.  This is an interactive command
     because it may have to ask for the &quot;ownertrust&quot; values for keys.
     The user has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner
     of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys.  GnuPG
     only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned
     to a key.  Using the ‘--edit-key’ menu, the assigned value can be
     changed at any time.

‘--check-trustdb’
     Do trust database maintenance without user interaction.  From time
     to time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or
     signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be
     tracked.  Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and
     do it automatically unless ‘--no-auto-check-trustdb’ is set.  This
     command can be used to force a trust database check at any time.
     The processing is identical to that of ‘--update-trustdb’ but it
     skips keys with a not yet defined &quot;ownertrust&quot;.

     For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with
     ‘--batch’ in which case the trust database check is done only if a
     check is needed.  To force a run even in batch mode add the option
     ‘--yes’.

‘--export-ownertrust’
     Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup
     purposes as these values are the only ones which can&#39;t be
     re-created from a corrupted trustdb.  Example:
            gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt

‘--import-ownertrust’
     Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in ‘files’ (or
     STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten.  In case
     of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of
     the ownertrust values (e.g.  in the file ‘otrust.txt’), you may
     re-create the trustdb using these commands:
            cd ~/.gnupg
            rm trustdb.gpg
            gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt

‘--rebuild-keydb-caches’
     When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be
     used to create signature caches in the keyring.  It might be handy
     in other situations too.

‘--print-md ALGO’
‘--print-mds’
     Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files or
     STDIN.  With the second form (or a deprecated &quot;*&quot; for ALGO) digests
     for all available algorithms are printed.

‘--gen-random 0|1|2|16|30 COUNT’
     Emit COUNT random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2.  If
     COUNT is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes
     will be emitted.  If used with ‘--armor’ the output will be base64
     encoded.  The special level 16 uses a quality level of 1 and
     outputs an endless stream of hex-encoded octets.  The special level
     30 outputs random as 30 zBase-32 characters.

‘--gen-prime MODE BITS’
     Use the source, Luke :-).  The output format is subject to change
     with any release.

‘--enarmor’
‘--dearmor’
     Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor.
     This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not very
     useful.  The ‘--dearmor’ command can also be used to dearmor PEM
     armors.

‘--unwrap’
     This option modifies the command ‘--decrypt’ to output the original
     message with the encryption layer removed.  Thus the output will be
     an OpenPGP data structure which often means a signed OpenPGP
     message.  Note that this option may or may not remove a compression
     layer which is often found beneath the encryption layer.

‘--tofu-policy {auto|good|unknown|bad|ask} KEYS’
     Set the TOFU policy for all the bindings associated with the
     specified KEYS.  For more information about the meaning of the
     policies, *note trust-model-tofu::.  The KEYS may be specified
     either by their fingerprint (preferred) or their keyid.

4.1.3 How to manage your keys
-----------------------------

This section explains the main commands for key management.

‘--quick-generate-key USER-ID [ALGO [USAGE [EXPIRE]]]’
‘--quick-gen-key’
     This is a simple command to generate a standard key with one user
     id.  In contrast to ‘--generate-key’ the key is generated directly
     without the need to answer a bunch of prompts.  Unless the option
     ‘--yes’ is given, the key creation will be canceled if the given
     user id already exists in the keyring.

     If invoked directly on the console without any special options an
     answer to a &quot;Continue?&quot;  style confirmation prompt is required.  In
     case the user id already exists in the keyring a second prompt to
     force the creation of the key will show up.

     If ALGO or USAGE are given, only the primary key is created and no
     prompts are shown.  To specify an expiration date but still create
     a primary and subkey use &quot;default&quot; or &quot;future-default&quot; for ALGO and
     &quot;default&quot; for USAGE.  For a description of these optional arguments
     see the command ‘--quick-add-key’.  The USAGE accepts also the
     value &quot;cert&quot; which can be used to create a certification only
     primary key; the default is to a create certification and signing
     key.

     The EXPIRE argument can be used to specify an expiration date for
     the key.  Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats
     &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot; or &quot;YYYYMMDDThhmmss&quot; are used.  To make the key expire
     in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use
     &quot;seconds=N&quot;, &quot;Nd&quot;, &quot;Nw&quot;, &quot;Nm&quot;, or &quot;Ny&quot; respectively.  Not
     specifying a value, or using &quot;-&quot; results in a key expiring in a
     reasonable default interval.  The values &quot;never&quot;, &quot;none&quot; can be
     used for no expiration date.

     If this command is used with ‘--batch’, ‘--pinentry-mode’ has been
     set to ‘loopback’, and one of the passphrase options
     (‘--passphrase’, ‘--passphrase-fd’, or ‘--passphrase-file’) is
     used, the supplied passphrase is used for the new key and the agent
     does not ask for it.  To create a key without any protection
     ‘--passphrase &#39;&#39;’ may be used.

     To create an OpenPGP key from the keys available on the currently
     inserted smartcard, the special string &quot;card&quot; can be used for ALGO.
     If the card features an encryption and a signing key, gpg will
     figure them out and creates an OpenPGP key consisting of the usual
     primary key and one subkey.  This works only with certain
     smartcards.  Note that the interactive ‘--full-gen-key’ command
     allows one to do the same but with greater flexibility in the
     selection of the smartcard keys.

     Note that it is possible to create a primary key and a subkey using
     non-default algorithms by using &quot;default&quot; and changing the default
     parameters using the option ‘--default-new-key-algo’.

‘--quick-set-expire FPR EXPIRE [*|SUBFPRS]’
     With two arguments given, directly set the expiration time of the
     primary key identified by FPR to EXPIRE.  To remove the expiration
     time ‘0’ can be used.  With three arguments and the third given as
     an asterisk, the expiration time of all non-revoked and not yet
     expired subkeys are set to EXPIRE.  With more than two arguments
     and a list of fingerprints given for SUBFPRS, all non-revoked
     subkeys matching these fingerprints are set to EXPIRE.

‘--quick-add-key FPR [ALGO [USAGE [EXPIRE]]]’
     Directly add a subkey to the key identified by the fingerprint FPR.
     Without the optional arguments an encryption subkey is added.  If
     any of the arguments are given a more specific subkey is added.

     ALGO may be any of the supported algorithms or curve names given in
     the format as used by key listings.  To use the default algorithm
     the string &quot;default&quot; or &quot;-&quot; can be used.  Supported algorithms are
     &quot;rsa&quot;, &quot;dsa&quot;, &quot;elg&quot;, &quot;ed25519&quot;, &quot;cv25519&quot;, and other ECC curves.
     For example the string &quot;rsa&quot; adds an RSA key with the default key
     length; a string &quot;rsa4096&quot; requests that the key length is 4096
     bits.  The string &quot;future-default&quot; is an alias for the algorithm
     which will likely be used as default algorithm in future versions
     of gpg.  To list the supported ECC curves the command ‘gpg
     --with-colons --list-config curve’ can be used.

     Depending on the given ALGO the subkey may either be an encryption
     subkey or a signing subkey.  If an algorithm is capable of signing
     and encryption and such a subkey is desired, a USAGE string must be
     given.  This string is either &quot;default&quot; or &quot;-&quot; to keep the default
     or a comma delimited list (or space delimited list) of keywords:
     &quot;sign&quot; for a signing subkey, &quot;auth&quot; for an authentication subkey,
     and &quot;encr&quot; for an encryption subkey (&quot;encrypt&quot; can be used as alias
     for &quot;encr&quot;).  The valid combinations depend on the algorithm.

     The EXPIRE argument can be used to specify an expiration date for
     the key.  Several formats are supported; commonly the ISO formats
     &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot; or &quot;YYYYMMDDThhmmss&quot; are used.  To make the key expire
     in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use
     &quot;seconds=N&quot;, &quot;Nd&quot;, &quot;Nw&quot;, &quot;Nm&quot;, or &quot;Ny&quot; respectively.  Not
     specifying a value, or using &quot;-&quot; results in a key expiring in a
     reasonable default interval.  The values &quot;never&quot;, &quot;none&quot; can be
     used for no expiration date.

‘--quick-add-adsk FPR ADSKFPR’
     Directly add an Additional Decryption Subkey to the key identified
     by the fingerprint FPR.  ADSKFPR is the fingerprint of another
     key&#39;s encryption subkey.  A subkey is commonly used here because by
     default a primary key has no encryption capability.  Use the option
     ‘--with-subkey-fingerprint’ with a list command to display the
     subkey fingerprints.

‘--generate-key’
‘--gen-key’
     Generate a new key pair using the current default parameters.  This
     is the standard command to create a new key.  In addition to the
     key a revocation certificate is created and stored in the
     ‘openpgp-revocs.d’ directory below the GnuPG home directory.

‘--full-generate-key’
‘--full-gen-key’
     Generate a new key pair with dialogs for all options.  This is an
     extended version of ‘--generate-key’.

     There is also a feature which allows you to create keys in batch
     mode.  See the manual section &quot;Unattended key generation&quot; on how to
     use this.

‘--generate-revocation NAME’
‘--gen-revoke NAME’
     Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key.  To only
     revoke a subkey or a key signature, use the ‘--edit’ command.

     This command merely creates the revocation certificate so that it
     can be used to revoke the key if that is ever needed.  To actually
     revoke a key the created revocation certificate needs to be merged
     with the key to revoke.  This is done by importing the revocation
     certificate using the ‘--import’ command.  Then the revoked key
     needs to be published, which is best done by sending the key to a
     keyserver (command ‘--send-key’) and by exporting (‘--export’) it
     to a file which is then send to frequent communication partners.

‘--generate-designated-revocation NAME’
‘--desig-revoke NAME’
     Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key.  This
     allows a user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke
     someone else&#39;s key.

‘--edit-key’
     Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key management
     related tasks.  It expects the specification of a key on the
     command line.

     uid N
          Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user ID with index
          N.  Use ‘*’ to select all and ‘0’ to deselect all.

     key N
          Toggle selection of subkey with index N or key ID N.  Use ‘*’
          to select all and ‘0’ to deselect all.

     sign
          Make a signature on key of user ‘name’.  If the key is not yet
          signed by the default user (or the users given with ‘-u’), the
          program displays the information of the key again, together
          with its fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed.
          This question is repeated for all users specified with ‘-u’.

     lsign
          Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is marked as non-exportable
          and will therefore never be used by others.  This may be used
          to make keys valid only in the local environment.

     nrsign
          Same as &quot;sign&quot; but the signature is marked as non-revocable
          and can therefore never be revoked.

     tsign
          Make a trust signature.  This is a signature that combines the
          notions of certification (like a regular signature), and trust
          (like the &quot;trust&quot; command).  It is generally useful in
          distinct communities or groups to implement the concept of a
          Trusted Introducer.  For more information please read the
          sections &quot;Trust Signature&quot; and &quot;Regular Expression&quot; in
          RFC-4880.

     Note that &quot;l&quot; (for local / non-exportable), &quot;nr&quot; (for
     non-revocable, and &quot;t&quot; (for trust) may be freely mixed and prefixed
     to &quot;sign&quot; to create a signature of any type desired.

     If the option ‘--only-sign-text-ids’ is specified, then any
     non-text based user ids (e.g., photo IDs) will not be selected for
     signing.

     delsig
          Delete a signature.  Note that it is not possible to retract a
          signature, once it has been send to the public (i.e.  to a
          keyserver).  In that case you better use ‘revsig’.

     revsig
          Revoke a signature.  For every signature which has been
          generated by one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a
          revocation certificate should be generated.

     check
          Check the signatures on all selected user IDs.  With the extra
          option ‘selfsig’ only self-signatures are shown.

     adduid
          Create an additional user ID.

     addphoto
          Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG
          file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a very
          large JPEG will make for a very large key.  Also note that
          some programs will display your JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and
          some programs will scale it to fit in a dialog box (PGP).

     showphoto
          Display the selected photographic user ID.

     deluid
          Delete a user ID or photographic user ID. Note that it is not
          possible to retract a user id, once it has been send to the
          public (i.e.  to a keyserver).  In that case you better use
          ‘revuid’.

     revuid
          Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.

     primary
          Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the
          primary user id flag from all other user ids and sets the
          timestamp of all affected self-signatures one second ahead.
          Note that setting a photo user ID as primary makes it primary
          over other photo user IDs, and setting a regular user ID as
          primary makes it primary over other regular user IDs.

     keyserver
          Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s).  This
          allows other users to know where you prefer they get your key
          from.  See ‘--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url’ for more
          on how this works.  Setting a value of &quot;none&quot; removes an
          existing preferred keyserver.

     notation
          Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s).  See
          ‘--cert-notation’ for more on how this works.  Setting a value
          of &quot;none&quot; removes all notations, setting a notation prefixed
          with a minus sign (-) removes that notation, and setting a
          notation name (without the =value) prefixed with a minus sign
          removes all notations with that name.

     pref
          List preferences from the selected user ID. This shows the
          actual preferences, without including any implied preferences.

     showpref
          More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID.
          This shows the preferences in effect by including the implied
          preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed
          (compression) if they are not already included in the
          preference list.  In addition, the preferred keyserver and
          signature notations (if any) are shown.

     setpref STRING
          Set the list of user ID preferences to STRING for all (or just
          the selected) user IDs.  Calling setpref with no arguments
          sets the preference list to the default (either built-in or
          set via ‘--default-preference-list’), and calling setpref with
          &quot;none&quot; as the argument sets an empty preference list.  Use
          ‘gpg --version’ to get a list of available algorithms.  Note
          that while you can change the preferences on an attribute user
          ID (aka &quot;photo ID&quot;), GnuPG does not select keys via attribute
          user IDs so these preferences will not be used by GnuPG. Note
          that an unattended version of this command is available as
          ‘--quick-update-pref’.

          When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in
          the order which you&#39;d like to see them used by someone else
          when encrypting a message to your key.  If you don&#39;t include
          3DES, it will be automatically added at the end.  Note that
          there are many factors that go into choosing an algorithm (for
          example, your key may not be the only recipient), and so the
          remote OpenPGP application being used to send to you may or
          may not follow your exact chosen order for a given message.
          It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is present on
          the preference list of every recipient key.  See also the
          INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.

     addkey
          Add a subkey to this key.

     addcardkey
          Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.

     keytocard
          Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no
          subkey has been selected) to a smartcard.  The secret key in
          the keyring will be replaced by a stub if the key could be
          stored successfully on the card and you use the save command
          later.  Only certain key types may be transferred to the card.
          A sub menu allows you to select on what card to store the key.
          Note that it is not possible to get that key back from the
          card - if the card gets broken your secret key will be lost
          unless you have a backup somewhere.

     bkuptocard FILE
          Restore the given FILE to a card.  This command may be used to
          restore a backup key (as generated during card initialization)
          to a new card.  In almost all cases this will be the
          encryption key.  You should use this command only with the
          corresponding public key and make sure that the file given as
          argument is indeed the backup to restore.  You should then
          select 2 to restore as encryption key.  You will first be
          asked to enter the passphrase of the backup key and then for
          the Admin PIN of the card.

     keytotpm
          Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no
          subkey has been selected) to TPM form.  The secret key in the
          keyring will be replaced by the TPM representation of that
          key, which can only be read by the particular TPM that created
          it (so the keyfile now becomes locked to the laptop containing
          the TPM). Only certain key types may be transferred to the TPM
          (all TPM 2.0 systems are mandated to have the rsa2048 and
          nistp256 algorithms but newer TPMs may have more).  Note that
          the key itself is not transferred into the TPM, merely
          encrypted by the TPM in-place, so if the keyfile is deleted,
          the key will be lost.  Once transferred to TPM representation,
          the key file can never be converted back to non-TPM form and
          the key will die when the TPM does, so you should first have a
          backup on secure offline storage of the actual secret key file
          before conversion.  It is essential to use the physical system
          TPM that you have rw permission on the TPM resource manager
          device (/dev/tpmrm0).  Usually this means you must be a member
          of the tss group.

     delkey
          Remove a subkey (secondary key).  Note that it is not possible
          to retract a subkey, once it has been send to the public (i.e.
          to a keyserver).  In that case you better use ‘revkey’.  Also
          note that this only deletes the public part of a key.

     revkey
          Revoke a subkey.

     expire
          Change the key or subkey expiration time.  If a subkey is
          selected, the expiration time of this subkey will be changed.
          With no selection, the key expiration of the primary key is
          changed.

     trust
          Change the owner trust value for the key.  This updates the
          trust-db immediately and no save is required.

     disable
     enable
          Disable or enable an entire key.  A disabled key can not
          normally be used for encryption.

     addrevoker
          Add a designated revoker to the key.  This takes one optional
          argument: &quot;sensitive&quot;.  If a designated revoker is marked as
          sensitive, it will not be exported by default (see
          export-options).

     addadsk
          Add an Additional Decryption Subkey.  The user is asked to
          enter the fingerprint of another encryption subkey.  Note that
          the exact fingerprint of another key&#39;s encryption subkey needs
          to be entered.  This is because commonly the primary key has
          no encryption capability.  Use the option
          ‘--with-subkey-fingerprint’ with a list command to display the
          subkey fingerprints.

     passwd
          Change the passphrase of the secret key.

     toggle
          This is dummy command which exists only for backward
          compatibility.

     clean
          Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any
          user ID that is no longer usable (e.g.  revoked, or expired).
          Then, remove any signatures that are not usable by the trust
          calculations.  Specifically, this removes any signature that
          does not validate, any signature that is superseded by a later
          signature, revoked signatures, and signatures issued by keys
          that are not present on the keyring.

     minimize
          Make the key as small as possible.  This removes all
          signatures from each user ID except for the most recent
          self-signature.

     change-usage
          Change the usage flags (capabilities) of the primary key or of
          subkeys.  These usage flags (e.g.  Certify, Sign,
          Authenticate, Encrypt) are set during key creation.  Sometimes
          it is useful to have the opportunity to change them (for
          example to add Authenticate) after they have been created.
          Please take care when doing this; the allowed usage flags
          depend on the key algorithm.

     cross-certify
          Add cross-certification signatures to signing subkeys that may
          not currently have them.  Cross-certification signatures
          protect against a subtle attack against signing subkeys.  See
          ‘--require-cross-certification’.  All new keys generated have
          this signature by default, so this command is only useful to
          bring older keys up to date.

     save
          Save all changes to the keyring and quit.

     quit
          Quit the program without updating the keyring.

     The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys and all user
     IDs.  The primary user ID is indicated by a dot, and selected keys
     or user IDs are indicated by an asterisk.  The trust value is
     displayed with the primary key: &quot;trust&quot; is the assigned owner trust
     and &quot;validity&quot; is the calculated validity of the key.  Validity
     values are also displayed for all user IDs.  For possible values of
     trust, *note trust-values::.

‘--sign-key NAME’
     Signs a public key with your secret key.  This is a shortcut
     version of the subcommand &quot;sign&quot; from ‘--edit-key’.

‘--lsign-key NAME’
     Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as
     non-exportable.  This is a shortcut version of the subcommand
     &quot;lsign&quot; from ‘--edit-key’.

‘--quick-sign-key FPR [NAMES]’
‘--quick-lsign-key FPR [NAMES]’
     Directly sign a key from the passphrase without any further user
     interaction.  The FPR must be the verified primary fingerprint of a
     key in the local keyring.  If no NAMES are given, all useful user
     ids are signed; with given [NAMES] only useful user ids matching
     one of these names are signed.  By default, or if a name is
     prefixed with a &#39;*&#39;, a case insensitive substring match is used.
     If a name is prefixed with a &#39;=&#39; a case sensitive exact match is
     done.

     The command ‘--quick-lsign-key’ marks the signatures as
     non-exportable.  If such a non-exportable signature already exists
     the ‘--quick-sign-key’ turns it into a exportable signature.  If
     you need to update an existing signature, for example to add or
     change notation data, you need to use the option
     ‘--force-sign-key’.

     This command uses reasonable defaults and thus does not provide the
     full flexibility of the &quot;sign&quot; subcommand from ‘--edit-key’.  Its
     intended use is to help unattended key signing by utilizing a list
     of verified fingerprints.

‘--quick-add-uid USER-ID NEW-USER-ID’
     This command adds a new user id to an existing key.  In contrast to
     the interactive sub-command ‘adduid’ of ‘--edit-key’ the
     NEW-USER-ID is added verbatim with only leading and trailing white
     space removed, it is expected to be UTF-8 encoded, and no checks on
     its form are applied.

‘--quick-revoke-uid USER-ID USER-ID-TO-REVOKE’
     This command revokes a user ID on an existing key.  It cannot be
     used to revoke the last user ID on key (some non-revoked user ID
     must remain), with revocation reason &quot;User ID is no longer valid&quot;.
     If you want to specify a different revocation reason, or to supply
     supplementary revocation text, you should use the interactive
     sub-command ‘revuid’ of ‘--edit-key’.

‘--quick-revoke-sig FPR SIGNING-FPR [NAMES]’
     This command revokes the key signatures made by SIGNING-FPR from
     the key specified by the fingerprint FPR.  With NAMES given only
     the signatures on user ids of the key matching any of the given
     names are affected (see ‘--quick-sign-key’).  If a revocation
     already exists a notice is printed instead of creating a new
     revocation; no error is returned in this case.  Note that key
     signature revocations may be superseded by a newer key signature
     and in turn again revoked.

‘--quick-set-primary-uid USER-ID PRIMARY-USER-ID’
     This command sets or updates the primary user ID flag on an
     existing key.  USER-ID specifies the key and PRIMARY-USER-ID the
     user ID which shall be flagged as the primary user ID. The primary
     user ID flag is removed from all other user ids and the timestamp
     of all affected self-signatures is set one second ahead.

‘--quick-update-pref USER-ID’
     This command updates the preference list of the key to the current
     default value (either built-in or set via
     ‘--default-preference-list’).  This is the unattended version of of
     using &quot;setpref&quot; in the ‘--key-edit’ menu without giving a list.
     Note that you can show the preferences in a key listing by using
     ‘--list-options show-pref’ or ‘--list-options show-pref-verbose’.
     You should also re-distribute updated keys to your peers.

‘--change-passphrase USER-ID’
‘--passwd USER-ID’
     Change the passphrase of the secret key belonging to the
     certificate specified as USER-ID.  This is a shortcut for the
     sub-command ‘passwd’ of the ‘--edit-key’ menu.  When using together
     with the option ‘--dry-run’ this will not actually change the
     passphrase but check that the current passphrase is correct.

4.2 Option Summary
==================

‘gpg’ features a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to
change the default configuration.

* Menu:

* GPG Configuration Options::   How to change the configuration.
* GPG Key related Options::     Key related options.
* GPG Input and Output::        Input and Output.
* OpenPGP Options::             OpenPGP protocol specific options.
* Compliance Options::          Compliance options.
* GPG Esoteric Options::        Doing things one usually doesn&#39;t want to do.
* Deprecated Options::          Deprecated options.

   Long options can be put in an options file (default
&quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;).  Short option names will not work - for example,
&quot;armor&quot; is a valid option for the options file, while &quot;a&quot; is not.  Do
not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any
required arguments.  Lines with a hash (&#39;#&#39;) as the first
non-white-space character are ignored.  Commands may be put in this file
too, but that is not generally useful as the command will execute
automatically with every execution of gpg.

   Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is
encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option
‘--’.

4.2.1 How to change the configuration
-------------------------------------

These options are used to change the configuration and most of them are
usually found in the option file.

‘--default-key NAME’
     Use NAME as the default key to sign with.  If this option is not
     used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring.
     Note that ‘-u’ or ‘--local-user’ overrides this option.  This
     option may be given multiple times.  In this case, the last key for
     which a secret key is available is used.  If there is no secret key
     available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will not emit an
     error message but continue as if this option wasn&#39;t given.

‘--default-recipient NAME’
     Use NAME as default recipient if option ‘--recipient’ is not used
     and don&#39;t ask if this is a valid one.  NAME must be non-empty.

‘--default-recipient-self’
     Use the default key as default recipient if option ‘--recipient’ is
     not used and don&#39;t ask if this is a valid one.  The default key is
     the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with
     ‘--default-key’.

‘--no-default-recipient’
     Reset ‘--default-recipient’ and ‘--default-recipient-self’.  Should
     not be used in an option file.

‘-v, --verbose’
     Give more information during processing.  If used twice, the input
     data is listed in detail.

‘--no-verbose’
     Reset verbose level to 0.  Should not be used in an option file.

‘-q, --quiet’
     Try to be as quiet as possible.  Should not be used in an option
     file.

‘--batch’
‘--no-batch’
     Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands.
     ‘--no-batch’ disables this option.  Note that even with a filename
     given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from STDIN
     (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached
     signature and no data file has been specified).  Thus if you do not
     want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
     ‘/dev/null’.

     It is highly recommended to use this option along with the options
     ‘--status-fd’ and ‘--with-colons’ for any unattended use of ‘gpg’.
     Should not be used in an option file.

‘--no-tty’
     Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any output.
     This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG sometimes prints
     warnings to the TTY even if ‘--batch’ is used.

‘--yes’
     Assume &quot;yes&quot; on most questions.  Should not be used in an option
     file.

‘--no’
     Assume &quot;no&quot; on most questions.  Should not be used in an option
     file.

‘--list-filter {select=EXPR}’
     A list filter can be used to output only certain keys during key
     listing commands.  For the available property names, see the
     description of ‘--import-filter’.

‘--list-options PARAMETERS’
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used
     when listing keys and signatures (that is, ‘--list-keys’,
     ‘--check-signatures’, ‘--list-public-keys’, ‘--list-secret-keys’,
     and the ‘--edit-key’ functions).  Options can be prepended with a
     ‘no-’ (after the two dashes) to give the opposite meaning.  The
     options are:

     show-photos
          Causes ‘--list-keys’, ‘--check-signatures’,
          ‘--list-public-keys’, and ‘--list-secret-keys’ to display any
          photo IDs attached to the key.  Defaults to no.  See also
          ‘--photo-viewer’.  Does not work with ‘--with-colons’: see
          ‘--attribute-fd’ for the appropriate way to get photo data for
          scripts and other frontends.

     show-usage
          Show usage information for keys and subkeys in the standard
          key listing.  This is a list of letters indicating the allowed
          usage for a key (‘E’=encryption, ‘S’=signing,
          ‘C’=certification, ‘A’=authentication).  Defaults to yes.

     show-policy-urls
          Show policy URLs in the ‘--check-signatures’ listings.
          Defaults to no.

     show-notations
     show-std-notations
     show-user-notations
          Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations
          in the ‘--check-signatures’ listings.  Defaults to no.

     show-keyserver-urls
          Show any preferred keyserver URL in the ‘--check-signatures’
          listings.  Defaults to no.

     show-uid-validity
          Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key
          listings.  Defaults to yes.

     show-unusable-uids
          Show revoked and expired user IDs in key listings.  Defaults
          to no.

     show-unusable-subkeys
          Show revoked and expired subkeys in key listings.  Defaults to
          no.

     show-unusable-sigs
          Show key signature made using weak or unsupported algorithms.

     show-keyring
          Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show
          which keyring a given key resides on.  Defaults to no.

     show-sig-expire
          Show signature expiration dates (if any) during
          ‘--check-signatures’ listings.  Defaults to no.

     show-sig-subpackets
          Include signature subpackets in the key listing.  This option
          can take an optional argument list of the subpackets to list.
          If no argument is passed, list all subpackets.  Defaults to
          no.  This option is only meaningful when using ‘--with-colons’
          along with ‘--check-signatures’.

     show-only-fpr-mbox
          For each user-id which has a valid mail address print only the
          fingerprint followed by the mail address.

     sort-sigs
          With -list-sigs and -check-sigs sort the signatures by keyID
          and creation time to make it easier to view the history of
          these signatures.  The self-signature is also listed before
          other signatures.  Defaults to yes.

‘--verify-options PARAMETERS’
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used
     when verifying signatures.  Options can be prepended with a &#39;no-&#39;
     to give the opposite meaning.  The options are:

     show-photos
          Display any photo IDs present on the key that issued the
          signature.  Defaults to no.  See also ‘--photo-viewer’.

     show-policy-urls
          Show policy URLs in the signature being verified.  Defaults to
          yes.

     show-notations
     show-std-notations
     show-user-notations
          Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations
          in the signature being verified.  Defaults to IETF standard.

     show-keyserver-urls
          Show any preferred keyserver URL in the signature being
          verified.  Defaults to yes.

     show-uid-validity
          Display the calculated validity of the user IDs on the key
          that issued the signature.  Defaults to yes.

     show-unusable-uids
          Show revoked and expired user IDs during signature
          verification.  Defaults to no.

     show-primary-uid-only
          Show only the primary user ID during signature verification.
          That is all the AKA lines as well as photo Ids are not shown
          with the signature verification status.

‘--enable-large-rsa’
‘--disable-large-rsa’
     With -generate-key and -batch, enable the creation of RSA secret
     keys as large as 8192 bit.  Note: 8192 bit is more than is
     generally recommended.  These large keys don&#39;t significantly
     improve security, but they are more expensive to use, and their
     signatures and certifications are larger.  This option is only
     available if the binary was build with large-secmem support.

‘--enable-dsa2’
‘--disable-dsa2’
     Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to
     1024 bit.  This is also the default with ‘--openpgp’.  Note that
     older versions of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the
     generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit.

‘--photo-viewer STRING’
     This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID.
     &quot;%i&quot; will be expanded to a filename containing the photo.  &quot;%I&quot;
     does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer
     exits.  Other flags are &quot;%k&quot; for the key ID, &quot;%K&quot; for the long key
     ID, &quot;%f&quot; for the key fingerprint, &quot;%t&quot; for the extension of the
     image type (e.g.  &quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the MIME type of the image (e.g.
     &quot;image/jpeg&quot;), &quot;%v&quot; for the single-character calculated validity of
     the image being viewed (e.g.  &quot;f&quot;), &quot;%V&quot; for the calculated
     validity as a string (e.g.  &quot;full&quot;), &quot;%U&quot; for a base32 encoded hash
     of the user ID, and &quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent sign.  If neither %i
     or %I are present, then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on
     standard input.

     On Unix the default viewer is ‘xloadimage -fork -quiet -title
     &#39;KeyID 0x%k&#39; STDIN’ with a fallback to ‘display -title &#39;KeyID 0x%k&#39;
     %i’ and finally to ‘xdg-open %i’.  On Windows ‘!ShellExecute 400
     %i’ is used; here the command is a meta command to use that API
     call followed by a wait time in milliseconds which is used to give
     the viewer time to read the temporary image file before gpg deletes
     it again.  Note that if your image viewer program is not secure,
     then executing it from gpg does not make it secure.

‘--exec-path STRING’
     Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers If not
     provided photo viewers use the ‘PATH’ environment variable.

‘--keyring FILE’
     Add FILE to the current list of keyrings.  If FILE begins with a
     tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory.  If
     the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
     GnuPG home directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; unless ‘--homedir’ or $GNUPGHOME
     is used).

     Note that this adds a keyring to the current list.  If the intent
     is to use the specified keyring alone, use ‘--keyring’ along with
     ‘--no-default-keyring’.

     If the option ‘--no-keyring’ has been used no keyrings will be used
     at all.

     Note that if the option ‘use-keyboxd’ is enabled in ‘common.conf’,
     no keyrings are used at all and keys are all maintained by the
     keyboxd process in its own database.

‘--primary-keyring FILE’
     This is a varian of ‘--keyring’ and designates FILE as the primary
     public keyring.  This means that newly imported keys (via
     ‘--import’ or keyserver ‘--recv-from’) will go to this keyring.

‘--secret-keyring FILE’
     This is an obsolete option and ignored.  All secret keys are stored
     in the ‘private-keys-v1.d’ directory below the GnuPG home
     directory.

‘--trustdb-name FILE’
     Use FILE instead of the default trustdb.  If FILE begins with a
     tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory.  If
     the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
     GnuPG home directory (‘~/.gnupg’ if ‘--homedir’ or $GNUPGHOME is
     not used).

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘--display-charset NAME’
     Set the name of the native character set.  This is used to convert
     some informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8
     encoding.  Note that this has nothing to do with the character set
     of data to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode
     user-supplied data.  If this option is not used, the default
     character set is determined from the current locale.  A verbosity
     level of 3 shows the chosen set.  This option should not be used on
     Windows.  Valid values for NAME are:

     iso-8859-1
          This is the Latin 1 set.

     iso-8859-2
          The Latin 2 set.

     iso-8859-15
          This is currently an alias for the Latin 1 set.

     koi8-r
          The usual Russian set (RFC-1489).

     utf-8
          Bypass all translations and assume that the OS uses native
          UTF-8 encoding.

‘--utf8-strings’
‘--no-utf8-strings’
     Assume that command line arguments are given as UTF-8 strings.  The
     default (‘--no-utf8-strings’) is to assume that arguments are
     encoded in the character set as specified by ‘--display-charset’.
     These options affect all following arguments.  Both options may be
     used multiple times.  This option should not be used in an option
     file.

     This option has no effect on Windows.  There the internal used
     UTF-8 encoding is translated for console input and output.  The
     command line arguments are expected as Unicode and translated to
     UTF-8.  Thus when calling this program from another, make sure to
     use the Unicode version of CreateProcess.

‘--options FILE’
     Read options from FILE and do not try to read them from the default
     options file in the homedir (see ‘--homedir’).  This option is
     ignored if used in an options file.

‘--no-options’
     Shortcut for ‘--options /dev/null’.  This option is detected before
     an attempt to open an option file.  Using this option will also
     prevent the creation of a ‘~/.gnupg’ homedir.

‘-z N’
‘--compress-level N’
‘--bzip2-compress-level N’
‘--no-compress’
     Set compression level to N for the ZIP and ZLIB compression
     algorithms.  The default is to use the default compression level of
     zlib (normally 6).  ‘--bzip2-compress-level’ sets the compression
     level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as
     well).  This is a different option from ‘--compress-level’ since
     BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional
     compression level.

     Option ‘-z’ sets both.  A value of 0 for N disables compression.  A
     value of -1 forces compression using the default level.  Option
     ‘--no-compress’ is identical to ‘-z0’.

     Except for the ‘--store’ command compression is always used unless
     ‘gpg’ detects that the input is already compressed.  To inhibit the
     use of compression use ‘-z0’ or ‘--no-compress’; to force
     compression use ‘-z-1’ or option ‘z’ with another compression level
     than the default as indicated by -1.  Note that this overriding of
     the default deection works only with ‘z’ and not with the long
     variant of this option.

‘--bzip2-decompress-lowmem’
     Use a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed files.
     This alternate method uses a bit more than half the memory, but
     also runs at half the speed.  This is useful under extreme low
     memory circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a
     high ‘--bzip2-compress-level’.

‘--mangle-dos-filenames’
‘--no-mangle-dos-filenames’
     Older version of Windows cannot handle filenames with more than one
     dot.  ‘--mangle-dos-filenames’ causes GnuPG to replace (rather than
     add to) the extension of an output filename to avoid this problem.
     This option is off by default and has no effect on non-Windows
     platforms.

‘--ask-cert-level’
‘--no-ask-cert-level’
     When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level.  If
     this option is not specified, the certification level used is set
     via ‘--default-cert-level’.  See ‘--default-cert-level’ for
     information on the specific levels and how they are used.
     ‘--no-ask-cert-level’ disables this option.  This option defaults
     to no.

‘--default-cert-level N’
     The default to use for the check level when signing a key.

     0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you
     verified the key.

     1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to
     own it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This
     is useful for a &quot;persona&quot; verification, where you sign the key of a
     pseudonymous user.

     2 means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this
     could mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the
     user ID on the key against a photo ID.

     3 means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example,
     this could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the
     owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by means of a
     hard to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that
     the name of the key owner matches the name in the user ID on the
     key, and finally that you verified (by exchange of email) that the
     email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

     Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just
     that: examples.  In the end, it is up to you to decide just what
     &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;extensive&quot; mean to you.

     This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).

‘--min-cert-level’
     When building the trust database, treat any signatures with a
     certification level below this as invalid.  Defaults to 2, which
     disregards level 1 signatures.  Note that level 0 &quot;no particular
     claim&quot; signatures are always accepted.

‘--trusted-key LONG KEY ID OR FINGERPRINT’
     Assume that the specified key (which should be given as
     fingerprint) is as trustworthy as one of your own secret keys.
     This option is useful if you don&#39;t want to keep your secret keys
     (or one of them) online but still want to be able to check the
     validity of a given recipient&#39;s or signator&#39;s key.  If the given
     key is not locally available but an LDAP keyserver is configured
     the missing key is imported from that server.

‘--add-desig-revoker [sensitive:]FINGERPRINT’
     Add the key specified by FINGERPRINT as a designated revoker to
     newly created keys.  If the fingerprint is prefixed with the
     keyword &quot;sensitive:&quot; that info is normally not exported wit the
     key.  This option may be given several time to add more than one
     designated revoker.  If the keyword &quot;clear&quot; is used instead of a
     fingerprint, all designated options previously encountered are
     discarded.  Designated revokers are marked on the key as
     non-revocable.  Note that a designated revoker specified using a
     parameter file will also be added to the key.

‘--trust-model {pgp|classic|tofu|tofu+pgp|direct|always|auto}’
     Set what trust model GnuPG should follow.  The models are:

     pgp
          This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as
          used in PGP 5.x and later.  This is the default trust model
          when creating a new trust database.

     classic
          This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2.

     tofu
          TOFU stands for Trust On First Use.  In this experimental
          trust model, the first time a key is seen, it is memorized.
          If later another key with a user id with the same email
          address is seen, both keys are marked as suspect.  In that
          case, the next time either is used, a warning is displayed
          describing the conflict, why it might have occurred (either
          the user generated a new key and failed to cross sign the old
          and new keys, the key is forgery, or a man-in-the-middle
          attack is being attempted), and the user is prompted to
          manually confirm the validity of the key in question.

          Because a potential attacker is able to control the email
          address and thereby circumvent the conflict detection
          algorithm by using an email address that is similar in
          appearance to a trusted email address, whenever a message is
          verified, statistics about the number of messages signed with
          the key are shown.  In this way, a user can easily identify
          attacks using fake keys for regular correspondents.

          When compared with the Web of Trust, TOFU offers significantly
          weaker security guarantees.  In particular, TOFU only helps
          ensure consistency (that is, that the binding between a key
          and email address doesn&#39;t change).  A major advantage of TOFU
          is that it requires little maintenance to use correctly.  To
          use the web of trust properly, you need to actively sign keys
          and mark users as trusted introducers.  This is a
          time-consuming process and anecdotal evidence suggests that
          even security-conscious users rarely take the time to do this
          thoroughly and instead rely on an ad-hoc TOFU process.

          In the TOFU model, policies are associated with bindings
          between keys and email addresses (which are extracted from
          user ids and normalized).  There are five policies, which can
          be set manually using the ‘--tofu-policy’ option.  The default
          policy can be set using the ‘--tofu-default-policy’ option.

          The TOFU policies are: ‘auto’, ‘good’, ‘unknown’, ‘bad’ and
          ‘ask’.  The ‘auto’ policy is used by default (unless
          overridden by ‘--tofu-default-policy’) and marks a binding as
          marginally trusted.  The ‘good’, ‘unknown’ and ‘bad’ policies
          mark a binding as fully trusted, as having unknown trust or as
          having trust never, respectively.  The ‘unknown’ policy is
          useful for just using TOFU to detect conflicts, but to never
          assign positive trust to a binding.  The final policy, ‘ask’
          prompts the user to indicate the binding&#39;s trust.  If batch
          mode is enabled (or input is inappropriate in the context),
          then the user is not prompted and the ‘undefined’ trust level
          is returned.

     tofu+pgp
          This experimental trust model combines TOFU with the Web of
          Trust.  This is done by computing the trust level for each
          model and then taking the maximum trust level where the trust
          levels are ordered as follows: ‘unknown &lt; undefined &lt; marginal
          &lt; fully &lt; ultimate &lt; expired &lt; never’.

          By setting ‘--tofu-default-policy=unknown’, this model can be
          used to implement the web of trust with TOFU&#39;s conflict
          detection algorithm, but without its assignment of positive
          trust values, which some security-conscious users don&#39;t like.

     direct
          Key validity is set directly by the user and not calculated
          via the Web of Trust.  This model is solely based on the key
          and does not distinguish user IDs.  Note that when changing to
          another trust model the trust values assigned to a key are
          transformed into ownertrust values, which also indicate how
          you trust the owner of the key to sign other keys.

     always
          Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully
          valid.  You generally won&#39;t use this unless you are using some
          external validation scheme.  This option also suppresses the
          &quot;[uncertain]&quot; tag printed with signature checks when there is
          no evidence that the user ID is bound to the key.  Note that
          this trust model still does not allow the use of expired,
          revoked, or disabled keys.

     auto
          Select the trust model depending on whatever the internal
          trust database says.  This is the default model if such a
          database already exists.  Note that a tofu trust model is not
          considered here and must be enabled explicitly.

‘--always-trust’
     Identical to ‘--trust-model always’.

‘--assert-signer FPR_OR_FILE’
     This option checks whether at least one valid signature on a file
     has been made with the specified key.  The key is either specified
     as a fingerprint or a file listing fingerprints.  The fingerprint
     must be given or listed in compact format (no colons or spaces in
     between).  This option can be given multiple times and each
     fingerprint is checked against the signing key as well as the
     corresponding primary key.  If FPR_OR_FILE specifies a file, empty
     lines are ignored as well as all lines starting with a hash sign.
     With this option gpg is guaranteed to return with an exit code of 0
     if and only if a signature has been encountered, is valid, and the
     key matches one of the fingerprints given by this option.

‘--assert-pubkey-algo ALGOLIST’
     During data signature verification this options checks whether the
     used public key algorithm matches the algorithms given by ALGOLIST.
     This option can be given multiple times to concatenate more
     algorithms to the list; the delimiter of the list are either commas
     or spaces.

     The algorithm names given in the list may either be verbatim names
     like &quot;ed25519&quot; with an optional leading single equal sign, or being
     prefixed with &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, or &quot;&lt;&quot;.  That prefix operator is
     applied to the number part of the algorithm name; for example 2048
     in &quot;rsa2048&quot; or 384 in &quot;brainpoolP384r1&quot;.  If the the leading
     non-digits in the name matches, the prefix operator is used to
     compare the number part, a trailing suffix is ignored in this case.
     For example an algorithm list &quot;&gt;rsa3000, &gt;=brainpool384r1,
     =ed25519&quot; allows RSA signatures with more that 3000 bits, Brainpool
     curves 384 and 512, and the ed25519 algorithm.

     With this option gpg (and also gpgv) is guaranteed to return with
     an exit code of 0 if and only if all valid signatures on data are
     made using a matching algorithm from the given list.

‘--auto-key-locate MECHANISMS’
‘--no-auto-key-locate’
     GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using
     this option.  This happens when encrypting to an email address (in
     the &quot;user@example.com&quot; form), and there are no &quot;user@example.com&quot;
     keys on the local keyring.  This option takes any number of the
     mechanisms listed below, in the order they are to be tried.
     Instead of listing the mechanisms as comma delimited arguments, the
     option may also be given several times to add more mechanism.  The
     option ‘--no-auto-key-locate’ or the mechanism &quot;clear&quot; resets the
     list.  The default is &quot;local,wkd&quot;.

     cert
          Locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398.

     dane
          Locate a key using DANE, as specified in
          draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-05.txt.

     wkd
          Locate a key using the Web Key Directory protocol.

     ldap
          Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in question for
          any LDAP keyservers to use.  If this fails, attempt to locate
          the key using the PGP Universal method of checking
          ‘ldap://keys.(thedomain)’.

     ntds
          Locate the key using the Active Directory (Windows only).
          This method also allows one to search by fingerprint using the
          command ‘--locate-external-key’.  Note that this mechanism is
          actually a shortcut for the mechanism ‘keyserver’ but using
          &quot;ldap:///&quot; as the keyserver.

     keyserver
          Locate a key using a keyserver.  This method also allows one
          to search by fingerprint using the command
          ‘--locate-external-key’ if any of the configured keyservers is
          an LDAP server.

     keyserver-URL
          In addition, a keyserver URL as used in the ‘dirmngr’
          configuration may be used here to query that particular
          keyserver.  This method also allows one to search by
          fingerprint using the command ‘--locate-external-key’ if the
          URL specifies an LDAP server.

     local
          Locate the key using the local keyrings.  This mechanism
          allows the user to select the order a local key lookup is
          done.  Thus using ‘--auto-key-locate local’ is identical to
          ‘--no-auto-key-locate’.

     nodefault
          This flag disables the standard local key lookup, done before
          any of the mechanisms defined by the ‘--auto-key-locate’ are
          tried.  The position of this mechanism in the list does not
          matter.  It is not required if ‘local’ is also used.

     clear
          Clear all defined mechanisms.  This is useful to override
          mechanisms given in a config file.  Note that a ‘nodefault’ in
          MECHANISMS will also be cleared unless it is given after the
          ‘clear’.

‘--auto-key-import’
‘--no-auto-key-import’
     This is an offline mechanism to get a missing key for signature
     verification and for later encryption to this key.  If this option
     is enabled and a signature includes an embedded key, that key is
     used to verify the signature and on verification success the key is
     imported.  The default is ‘--no-auto-key-import’.

     On the sender (signing) site the option ‘--include-key-block’ needs
     to be used to put the public part of the signing key as “Key Block
     subpacket” into the signature.

‘--auto-key-retrieve’
‘--no-auto-key-retrieve’
     These options enable or disable the automatic retrieving of keys
     from a keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are
     not on the local keyring.  The default is ‘--no-auto-key-retrieve’.

     The order of methods tried to lookup the key is:

     1.  If the option ‘--auto-key-import’ is set and the signatures
     includes an embedded key, that key is used to verify the signature
     and on verification success that key is imported.

     2.  If a preferred keyserver is specified in the signature and the
     option ‘honor-keyserver-url’ is active (which is not the default),
     that keyserver is tried.  Note that the creator of the signature
     uses the option ‘--sig-keyserver-url’ to specify the preferred
     keyserver for data signatures.

     3.  If the signature has the Signer&#39;s UID set (e.g.  using
     ‘--sender’ while creating the signature) a Web Key Directory (WKD)
     lookup is done.  This is the default configuration but can be
     disabled by removing WKD from the auto-key-locate list or by using
     the option ‘--disable-signer-uid’.

     4.  If any keyserver is configured and the Issuer Fingerprint is
     part of the signature (since GnuPG 2.1.16), the configured
     keyservers are tried.

     Note that this option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like behavior possible.
     Keyserver or Web Key Directory operators can see which keys you
     request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand new key
     (which you naturally will not have on your local keyring), the
     operator can tell both your IP address and the time when you
     verified the signature.

‘--keyid-format {none|short|0xshort|long|0xlong}’
     Select how to display key IDs.  &quot;none&quot; does not show the key ID at
     all but shows the fingerprint in a separate line.  &quot;short&quot; is the
     traditional 8-character key ID. &quot;long&quot; is the more accurate (but
     less convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an &quot;0x&quot; to either to
     include an &quot;0x&quot; at the beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560.
     Note that this option is ignored if the option ‘--with-colons’ is
     used.

‘--keyserver NAME’
     This option is deprecated - please use the ‘--keyserver’ in
     ‘dirmngr.conf’ instead.

     Use NAME as your keyserver.  This is the server that
     ‘--receive-keys’, ‘--send-keys’, and ‘--search-keys’ will
     communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for
     keys on.  The format of the NAME is a URI:
     &#39;scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]&#39; The scheme is the type of
     keyserver: &quot;hkp&quot;/&quot;hkps&quot; for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers or
     &quot;ldap&quot;/&quot;ldaps&quot; for the LDAP keyservers.  Note that your particular
     installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as
     well.  Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive.

     Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally
     no need to send keys to more than one server.  The keyserver
     ‘hkp://keys.gnupg.net’ uses round robin DNS to give a different
     keyserver each time you use it.

‘--keyserver-options {NAME=VALUE}’
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
     the keyserver.  Options can be prefixed with a &#39;no-&#39; to give the
     opposite meaning.  Valid import-options or export-options may be
     used here as well to apply to importing (‘--recv-key’) or exporting
     (‘--send-key’) a key from a keyserver.  While not all options are
     available for all keyserver types, some common options are:

     include-revoked
          When searching for a key with ‘--search-keys’, include keys
          that are marked on the keyserver as revoked.  Note that not
          all keyservers differentiate between revoked and unrevoked
          keys, and for such keyservers this option is meaningless.
          Note also that most keyservers do not have cryptographic
          verification of key revocations, and so turning this option
          off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked as
          revoked.

     include-disabled
          When searching for a key with ‘--search-keys’, include keys
          that are marked on the keyserver as disabled.  Note that this
          option is not used with HKP keyservers.

     auto-key-retrieve
          This is an obsolete alias for the option ‘auto-key-retrieve’.
          Please do not use it; it will be removed in future versions..

     honor-keyserver-url
          When using ‘--refresh-keys’, if the key in question has a
          preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to
          refresh the key from.  In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is
          set, and the signature being verified has a preferred
          keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to fetch the
          key from.  Note that this option introduces a &quot;web bug&quot;: The
          creator of the key can see when the keys is refreshed.  Thus
          this option is not enabled by default.

     include-subkeys
          When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets.
          Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they
          do not support retrieving keys by subkey id.

     timeout
     http-proxy=VALUE
     verbose
     debug
     check-cert
     ca-cert-file
          These options have no more function since GnuPG 2.1.  Use the
          ‘dirmngr’ configuration options instead.

     The default list of options is: &quot;self-sigs-only, repair-keys,
     repair-pks-subkey-bug, export-attributes&quot;.  However, if the actual
     used source is an LDAP server &quot;no-self-sigs-only&quot; is assumed unless
     &quot;self-sigs-only&quot; has been explicitly configured.

‘--completes-needed N’
     Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new key signer
     (defaults to 1).

‘--marginals-needed N’
     Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new key signer
     (defaults to 3)

‘--tofu-default-policy {auto|good|unknown|bad|ask}’
     The default TOFU policy (defaults to ‘auto’).  For more information
     about the meaning of this option, *note trust-model-tofu::.

‘--max-cert-depth N’
     Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).

‘--no-sig-cache’
     Do not cache the verification status of key signatures.  Caching
     gives a much better performance in key listings.  However, if you
     suspect that your public keyring is not safe against write
     modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching.  It
     probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of
     damage can be done if someone else has write access to your public
     keyring.

‘--auto-check-trustdb’
‘--no-auto-check-trustdb’
     If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of Trust has to
     be updated, it automatically runs the ‘--check-trustdb’ command
     internally.  This may be a time consuming process.
     ‘--no-auto-check-trustdb’ disables this option.

‘--use-agent’
‘--no-use-agent’
     This is dummy option.  ‘gpg’ always requires the agent.

‘--gpg-agent-info’
     This is dummy option.  It has no effect when used with ‘gpg’.

‘--agent-program FILE’
     Specify an agent program to be used for secret key operations.  The
     default value is determined by running ‘gpgconf’ with the option
     ‘--list-dirs’.  Note that the pipe symbol (‘|’) is used for a
     regression test suite hack and may thus not be used in the file
     name.

‘--dirmngr-program FILE’
     Specify a dirmngr program to be used for keyserver access.  The
     default value is ‘/usr/bin/dirmngr’.

‘--disable-dirmngr’
     Entirely disable the use of the Dirmngr.

‘--no-autostart’
     Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not yet been
     started and its service is required.  This option is mostly useful
     on machines where the connection to gpg-agent has been redirected
     to another machines.  If dirmngr is required on the remote machine,
     it may be started manually using ‘gpgconf --launch dirmngr’.

‘--lock-once’
     Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested and do not
     release the lock until the process terminates.

‘--lock-multiple’
     Release the locks every time a lock is no longer needed.  Use this
     to override a previous ‘--lock-once’ from a config file.

‘--lock-never’
     Disable locking entirely.  This option should be used only in very
     special environments, where it can be assured that only one process
     is accessing those files.  A bootable floppy with a stand-alone
     encryption system will probably use this.  Improper usage of this
     option may lead to data and key corruption.

‘--exit-on-status-write-error’
     This option will cause write errors on the status FD to immediately
     terminate the process.  That should in fact be the default but it
     never worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this, so
     that the change won&#39;t break applications which close their end of a
     status fd connected pipe too early.  Using this option along with
     ‘--enable-progress-filter’ may be used to cleanly cancel long
     running gpg operations.

‘--limit-card-insert-tries N’
     With N greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a
     smartcard gets limited to N-1.  Thus with a value of 1 gpg won&#39;t at
     all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at startup.
     This option is useful in the configuration file in case an
     application does not know about the smartcard support and waits ad
     infinitum for an inserted card.

‘--no-random-seed-file’
     GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over
     invocations.  This makes random generation faster; however
     sometimes write operations are not desired.  This option can be
     used to achieve that with the cost of slower random generation.

‘--no-greeting’
     Suppress the initial copyright message.

‘--no-secmem-warning’
     Suppress the warning about &quot;using insecure memory&quot;.

‘--no-permission-warning’
     Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory
     (‘--homedir’) permissions.  Note that the permission checks that
     GnuPG performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather
     they simply warn about certain common permission problems.  Do not
     assume that the lack of a warning means that your system is secure.

     Note that the warning for unsafe ‘--homedir’ permissions cannot be
     suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to
     place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to
     suppress warnings about itself.  The ‘--homedir’ permissions
     warning may only be suppressed on the command line.

‘--require-secmem’
‘--no-require-secmem’
     Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory.  Defaults to no
     (i.e.  run, but give a warning).

‘--require-cross-certification’
‘--no-require-cross-certification’
     When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the
     cross certification &quot;back signature&quot; on the subkey is present and
     valid.  This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that
     can sign.  Defaults to ‘--require-cross-certification’ for ‘gpg’.

‘--expert’
‘--no-expert’
     Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or &quot;silly&quot; things like
     signing an expired or revoked key, or certain potentially
     incompatible things like generating unusual key types.  This also
     disables certain warning messages about potentially incompatible
     actions.  As the name implies, this option is for experts only.  If
     you don&#39;t fully understand the implications of what it allows you
     to do, leave this off.  ‘--no-expert’ disables this option.

4.2.2 Key related options
-------------------------

‘--recipient NAME’
‘-r’
     Encrypt for user id NAME.  If this option or ‘--hidden-recipient’
     is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user-id unless
     ‘--default-recipient’ is given.

‘--hidden-recipient NAME’
‘-R’
     Encrypt for user ID NAME, but hide the key ID of this user&#39;s key.
     This option helps to hide the receiver of the message and is a
     limited countermeasure against traffic analysis.  If this option or
     ‘--recipient’ is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless
     ‘--default-recipient’ is given.

‘--recipient-file FILE’
‘-f’
     This option is similar to ‘--recipient’ except that it encrypts to
     a key stored in the given file.  FILE must be the name of a file
     containing exactly one key.  ‘gpg’ assumes that the key in this
     file is fully valid.

‘--hidden-recipient-file FILE’
‘-F’
     This option is similar to ‘--hidden-recipient’ except that it
     encrypts to a key stored in the given file.  FILE must be the name
     of a file containing exactly one key.  ‘gpg’ assumes that the key
     in this file is fully valid.

‘--encrypt-to NAME’
     Same as ‘--recipient’ but this one is intended for use in the
     options file and may be used with your own user-id as an
     &quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;.  These keys are only used when there are other
     recipients given either by use of ‘--recipient’ or by the asked
     user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user ids and
     even disabled keys can be used.

‘--hidden-encrypt-to NAME’
     Same as ‘--hidden-recipient’ but this one is intended for use in
     the options file and may be used with your own user-id as a hidden
     &quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;.  These keys are only used when there are other
     recipients given either by use of ‘--recipient’ or by the asked
     user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user ids and
     even disabled keys can be used.

‘--no-encrypt-to’
     Disable the use of all ‘--encrypt-to’ and ‘--hidden-encrypt-to’
     keys.

‘--group {NAME=VALUE}’
     Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email
     programs.  Any time the group name is a recipient (‘-r’ or
     ‘--recipient’), it will be expanded to the values specified.
     Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged into a
     single group.

     The values are ‘key IDs’ or fingerprints, but any key description
     is accepted.  Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated
     as two different values.  Note also there is only one level of
     expansion -- you cannot make an group that points to another group.
     When used from the command line, it may be necessary to quote the
     argument to this option to prevent the shell from treating it as
     multiple arguments.

‘--ungroup NAME’
     Remove a given entry from the ‘--group’ list.

‘--no-groups’
     Remove all entries from the ‘--group’ list.

‘--local-user NAME’
‘-u’
     Use NAME as the key to sign with.  Note that this option overrides
     ‘--default-key’.

‘--sender MBOX’
     This option has two purposes.  MBOX must either be a complete user
     ID containing a proper mail address or just a plain mail address.
     The option can be given multiple times.

     When creating a signature this option tells gpg the signing key&#39;s
     user id used to make the signature and embeds that user ID into the
     created signature (using OpenPGP&#39;s &quot;Signer&#39;s User ID&quot; subpacket).
     If the option is given multiple times a suitable user ID is picked.
     However, if the signing key was specified directly by using a mail
     address (i.e.  not by using a fingerprint or key ID) this option is
     used and the mail address is embedded in the created signature.

     When verifying a signature MBOX is used to restrict the information
     printed by the TOFU code to matching user IDs.  If the option is
     used and the signature contains a &quot;Signer&#39;s User ID&quot; subpacket that
     information is is also used to restrict the printed information.
     Note that GnuPG considers only the mail address part of a User ID.

     If this option or the said subpacket is available the TRUST lines
     as printed by option ‘status-fd’ correspond to the corresponding
     User ID; if no User ID is known the TRUST lines are computed
     directly on the key and do not give any information about the User
     ID. In the latter case it his highly recommended to scripts and
     other frontends to evaluate the VALIDSIG line, retrieve the key and
     print all User IDs along with their validity (trust) information.

‘--try-secret-key NAME’
     For hidden recipients GPG needs to know the keys to use for trial
     decryption.  The key set with ‘--default-key’ is always tried
     first, but this is often not sufficient.  This option allows
     setting more keys to be used for trial decryption.  Although any
     valid user-id specification may be used for NAME it makes sense to
     use at least the long keyid to avoid ambiguities.  Note that
     gpg-agent might pop up a pinentry for a lot keys to do the trial
     decryption.  If you want to stop all further trial decryption you
     may use close-window button instead of the cancel button.

‘--try-all-secrets’
     Don&#39;t look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all
     secret keys in turn to find the right decryption key.  This option
     forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by
     using ‘--throw-keyids’ or ‘--hidden-recipient’) and might come
     handy in case where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.

‘--skip-hidden-recipients’
‘--no-skip-hidden-recipients’
     During decryption skip all anonymous recipients.  This option helps
     in the case that people use the hidden recipients feature to hide
     their own encrypt-to key from others.  If one has many secret keys
     this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys are tried in
     turn to decrypt something which was not really intended for it.
     The drawback of this option is that it is currently not possible to
     decrypt a message which includes real anonymous recipients.

4.2.3 Input and Output
----------------------

‘--armor’
‘-a’
     Create ASCII armored output.  The default is to create the binary
     OpenPGP format.

‘--no-armor’
     Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored format.

‘--output FILE’
‘-o FILE’
     Write output to FILE.  To write to stdout use ‘-’ as the filename.

‘--max-output N’
     This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be
     generated when processing a file.  Since OpenPGP supports various
     levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given
     message may be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP
     message.  While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is
     often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be generated
     before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits.  Defaults to
     0, which means &quot;no limit&quot;.

‘--chunk-size N’
     The AEAD encryption mode encrypts the data in chunks so that a
     receiving side can check for transmission errors or tampering at
     the end of each chunk and does not need to delay this until all
     data has been received.  The used chunk size is 2^N byte.  The
     lowest allowed value for N is 6 (64 byte) and the largest is the
     default of 22 which creates chunks not larger than 4 MiB.

‘--input-size-hint N’
     This option can be used to tell GPG the size of the input data in
     bytes.  N must be a positive base-10 number.  This option is only
     useful if the input is not taken from a file.  GPG may use this
     hint to optimize its buffer allocation strategy.  It is also used
     by the ‘--status-fd’ line &quot;PROGRESS&quot; to provide a value for &quot;total&quot;
     if that is not available by other means.

‘--key-origin STRING[,URL]’
     gpg can track the origin of a key.  Certain origins are implicitly
     known (e.g.  keyserver, web key directory) and set.  For a standard
     import the origin of the keys imported can be set with this option.
     To list the possible values use &quot;help&quot; for STRING.  Some origins
     can store an optional URL argument.  That URL can appended to
     STRING after a comma.

‘--import-options PARAMETERS’
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
     importing keys.  Options can be prepended with a &#39;no-&#39; to give the
     opposite meaning.  The options are:

     import-local-sigs
          Allow importing key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;.  This is not
          generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used.
          Defaults to no.

     keep-ownertrust
          Normally possible still existing ownertrust values of a key
          are cleared if a key is imported.  This is in general
          desirable so that a formerly deleted key does not
          automatically gain an ownertrust values merely due to import.
          On the other hand it is sometimes necessary to re-import a
          trusted set of keys again but keeping already assigned
          ownertrust values.  This can be achieved by using this option.

     repair-pks-subkey-bug
          During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS
          keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with
          multiple subkeys.  Note that this cannot completely repair the
          damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the keyserver,
          but it does at least give you back one subkey.  Defaults to no
          for regular ‘--import’ and to yes for keyserver
          ‘--receive-keys’.

     import-show
     show-only
          Show a listing of the key as imported right before it is
          stored.  This can be combined with the option ‘--dry-run’ to
          only look at keys; the option ‘show-only’ is a shortcut for
          this combination.  The command ‘--show-keys’ is another
          shortcut for this.  Note that suffixes like &#39;#&#39; for &quot;sec&quot; and
          &quot;sbb&quot; lines may or may not be printed.

     import-export
          Run the entire import code but instead of storing the key to
          the local keyring write it to the output.  The export option
          ‘export-dane’ affect the output.  This option can for example
          be used to remove all invalid parts from a key without the
          need to store it.

     merge-only
          During import, allow key updates to existing keys, but do not
          allow any new keys to be imported.  Defaults to no.

     import-clean
          After import, compact (remove all signatures except the
          self-signature) any user IDs from the new key that are not
          usable.  Then, remove any signatures from the new key that are
          not usable.  This includes signatures that were issued by keys
          that are not present on the keyring.  This option is the same
          as running the ‘--edit-key’ command &quot;clean&quot; after import.
          Defaults to no.

     self-sigs-only
          Accept only self-signatures while importing a key.  All other
          key signatures are skipped at an early import stage.  This
          option can be used with ‘keyserver-options’ to mitigate
          attempts to flood a key with bogus signatures from a
          keyserver.  The drawback is that all other valid key
          signatures, as required by the Web of Trust are also not
          imported.  Note that when using this option along with
          import-clean it suppresses the final clean step after merging
          the imported key into the existing key.

     ignore-attributes
          Ignore all attribute user IDs (photo IDs) and their signatures
          while importing a key.

     repair-keys
          After import, fix various problems with the keys.  For
          example, this reorders signatures, and strips duplicate
          signatures.  Defaults to yes.

     bulk-import
          When used the keyboxd (option ‘use-keyboxd’ in ‘common.conf’)
          does the import within a single transaction.

     import-minimal
          Import the smallest key possible.  This removes all signatures
          except the most recent self-signature on each user ID. This
          option is the same as running the ‘--edit-key’ command
          &quot;minimize&quot; after import.  Defaults to no.

     restore
     import-restore
          Import in key restore mode.  This imports all data which is
          usually skipped during import; including all GnuPG specific
          data.  All other contradicting options are overridden.

‘--import-filter {NAME=EXPR}’
‘--export-filter {NAME=EXPR}’
     These options define an import/export filter which are applied to
     the imported/exported keyblock right before it will be
     stored/written.  NAME defines the type of filter to use, EXPR the
     expression to evaluate.  The option can be used several times which
     then appends more expression to the same NAME.

     The available filter types are:

     keep-uid
          This filter will keep a user id packet and its dependent
          packets in the keyblock if the expression evaluates to true.

     drop-subkey
          This filter drops the selected subkeys.  Currently only
          implemented for -export-filter.

     drop-sig
          This filter drops the selected key signatures on user ids.
          Self-signatures are not considered.  Currently only
          implemented for -import-filter.

     select
          This filter is only implemented by ‘--list-filter’.  All
          property names may be used.

     For the syntax of the expression see the chapter &quot;FILTER
     EXPRESSIONS&quot;. The property names for the expressions depend on the
     actual filter type and are indicated in the following table.  Note
     that all property names may also be used by ‘--list-filter’.

     Property names may be prefix with a scope delimited by a slash.
     Valid scopes are &quot;pub&quot; for public and secret primary keys, &quot;sub&quot;
     for public and secret subkeys, &quot;uid&quot; for for user-ID packets, and
     &quot;sig&quot; for signature packets.  Invalid scopes are currently ignored.

     The available properties are:

     uid
          A string with the user id.  (keep-uid)

     mbox
          The addr-spec part of a user id with mailbox or the empty
          string.  (keep-uid)

     algostr
          A string with the key algorithm description.  For example
          &quot;rsa3072&quot; or &quot;ed25519&quot;.

     key_algo
          A number with the public key algorithm of a key or subkey
          packet.  (drop-subkey)

     key_size
          A number with the effective key size of a key or subkey
          packet.  (drop-subkey)

     key_created
     key_created_d
          The first is the timestamp a public key or subkey packet was
          created.  The second is the same but given as an ISO string,
          e.g.  &quot;2016-08-17&quot;.  (drop-subkey)

     key_expires
     key_expires_d
          The expiration time of a public key or subkey or 0 if it does
          not expire.  The second is the same but given as an ISO date
          string or an empty string e.g.  &quot;2038-01-19&quot;.

     fpr
          The hexified fingerprint of the current subkey or primary key.
          (drop-subkey)

     primary
          Boolean indicating whether the user id is the primary one.
          (keep-uid)

     expired
          Boolean indicating whether a user id (keep-uid), a key
          (drop-subkey), or a signature (drop-sig) expired.

     revoked
          Boolean indicating whether a user id (keep-uid) or a key
          (drop-subkey) has been revoked.

     disabled
          Boolean indicating whether a primary key is disabled.

     secret
          Boolean indicating whether a key or subkey is a secret one.
          (drop-subkey)

     usage
          A string indicating the usage flags for the subkey, from the
          sequence &quot;ecsa?&quot;.  For example, a subkey capable of just
          signing and authentication would be an exact match for &quot;sa&quot;.
          (drop-subkey)

     sig_created
     sig_created_d
          The first is the timestamp a signature packet was created.
          The second is the same but given as an ISO date string, e.g.
          &quot;2016-08-17&quot;.  (drop-sig)

     sig_expires
     sig_expires_d
          The expiration time of a signature packet or 0 if it does not
          expire.  The second is the same but given as an ISO date
          string or an empty string e.g.  &quot;2038-01-19&quot;.

     sig_algo
          A number with the public key algorithm of a signature packet.
          (drop-sig)

     sig_digest_algo

          (drop-sig)

     origin
          A string with the key origin or a question mark.  For example
          the string &quot;wkd&quot; is used if a key originated from a Web Key
          Directory lookup.

     lastupd
          The timestamp the key was last updated from a keyserver or the
          Web Key Directory.

     url
          A string with the the URL associated wit the last key lookup.

‘--export-options PARAMETERS’
     This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for
     exporting keys.  Options can be prepended with a &#39;no-&#39; to give the
     opposite meaning.  The options are:

     export-local-sigs
          Allow exporting key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;.  This is not
          generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used.
          Defaults to no.

     export-attributes
          Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting.  Not
          including attribute user IDs is useful to export keys that are
          going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept
          attribute user IDs.  Defaults to yes.

     export-sensitive-revkeys
          Include designated revoker information that was marked as
          &quot;sensitive&quot;.  Defaults to no.

     backup
     export-backup
          Export for use as a backup.  The exported data includes all
          data which is needed to restore the key or keys later with
          GnuPG. The format is basically the OpenPGP format but enhanced
          with GnuPG specific data.  All other contradicting options are
          overridden.

     export-clean
          Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key being
          exported if the user IDs are not usable.  Also, do not export
          any signatures that are not usable.  This includes signatures
          that were issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.
          This option is the same as running the ‘--edit-key’ command
          &quot;clean&quot; before export except that the local copy of the key is
          not modified.  Defaults to no.

     export-minimal
          Export the smallest key possible.  This removes all signatures
          except the most recent self-signature on each user ID. This
          option is the same as running the ‘--edit-key’ command
          &quot;minimize&quot; before export except that the local copy of the key
          is not modified.  Defaults to no.

     export-revocs
          Export only standalone revocation certificates of the key.
          This option does not export revocations of 3rd party
          certificate revocations.

     export-dane
          Instead of outputting the key material output OpenPGP DANE
          records suitable to put into DNS zone files.  An ORIGIN line
          is printed before each record to allow diverting the records
          to the corresponding zone file.

     mode1003
          Enable the use of a new secret key export format.  This format
          avoids the re-encryption as required with the current OpenPGP
          format and also improves the security of the secret key if it
          has been protected with a passphrase.  Note that an
          unprotected key is exported as-is and thus not secure; the
          general rule to convey secret keys in an OpenPGP encrypted
          file still applies with this mode.  Versions of GnuPG before
          2.4.0 are not able to import such a secret file.

‘--with-colons’
     Print key listings delimited by colons.  Note that the output will
     be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any ‘--display-charset’ setting.
     This format is useful when GnuPG is called from scripts and other
     programs as it is easily machine parsed.  The details of this
     format are documented in the file ‘doc/DETAILS’, which is included
     in the GnuPG source distribution.

‘--fixed-list-mode’
     Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in ‘--with-colon’
     listing mode and print all timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01.
     Since GnuPG 2.0.10, this mode is always used and thus this option
     is obsolete; it does not harm to use it though.

‘--legacy-list-mode’
     Revert to the pre-2.1 public key list mode.  This only affects the
     human readable output and not the machine interface (i.e.
     ‘--with-colons’).  Note that the legacy format does not convey
     suitable information for elliptic curves.

‘--with-fingerprint’
     Same as the command ‘--fingerprint’ but changes only the format of
     the output and may be used together with another command.

‘--with-subkey-fingerprint’
     If a fingerprint is printed for the primary key, this option forces
     printing of the fingerprint for all subkeys.  This could also be
     achieved by using the ‘--with-fingerprint’ twice but by using this
     option along with keyid-format &quot;none&quot; a compact fingerprint is
     printed.

‘--with-v5-fingerprint’
     In a colon mode listing emit &quot;fp2&quot; lines for version 4 OpenPGP keys
     having a v5 style fingerprint of the key.

‘--with-icao-spelling’
     Print the ICAO spelling of the fingerprint in addition to the hex
     digits.

‘--with-keygrip’
     Include the keygrip in the key listings.  In ‘--with-colons’ mode
     this is implicitly enable for secret keys.

‘--with-key-origin’
     Include the locally held information on the origin and last update
     of a key in a key listing.  In ‘--with-colons’ mode this is always
     printed.  This data is currently experimental and shall not be
     considered part of the stable API.

‘--with-wkd-hash’
     Print a Web Key Directory identifier along with each user ID in key
     listings.  This is an experimental feature and semantics may
     change.

‘--with-secret’
     Include info about the presence of a secret key in public key
     listings done with ‘--with-colons’.

4.2.4 OpenPGP protocol specific options
---------------------------------------

‘-t, --textmode’
‘--no-textmode’
     Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical
     text form with standard &quot;CRLF&quot; line endings.  This also sets the
     necessary flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or
     signed data is text and may need its line endings converted back to
     whatever the local system uses.  This option is useful when
     communicating between two platforms that have different line ending
     conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc).
     ‘--no-textmode’ disables this option, and is the default.

‘--force-v3-sigs’
‘--no-force-v3-sigs’
‘--force-v4-certs’
‘--no-force-v4-certs’
     These options are obsolete and have no effect since GnuPG 2.1.

‘--force-ocb’
‘--force-aead’
     Force the use of AEAD encryption over MDC encryption.  AEAD is a
     modern and faster way to do authenticated encryption than the old
     MDC method.  ‘--force-aead’ is an alias and deprecated.  See also
     option ‘--chunk-size’.

‘--force-mdc’
‘--disable-mdc’
     These options are obsolete and have no effect since GnuPG 2.2.8.
     The MDC is always used unless the keys indicate that an AEAD
     algorithm can be used in which case AEAD is used.  But note: If the
     creation of a legacy non-MDC message is exceptionally required, the
     option ‘--rfc2440’ allows for this.

‘--disable-signer-uid’
     By default the user ID of the signing key is embedded in the data
     signature.  As of now this is only done if the signing key has been
     specified with ‘local-user’ using a mail address, or with ‘sender’.
     This information can be helpful for verifier to locate the key; see
     option ‘--auto-key-retrieve’.

‘--include-key-block’
‘--no-include-key-block’
     This option is used to embed the actual signing key into a data
     signature.  The embedded key is stripped down to a single user id
     and includes only the signing subkey used to create the signature
     as well as as valid encryption subkeys.  All other info is removed
     from the key to keep it and thus the signature small.  This option
     is the OpenPGP counterpart to the ‘gpgsm’ option ‘--include-certs’
     and allows the recipient of a signed message to reply encrypted to
     the sender without using any online directories to lookup the key.
     The default is ‘--no-include-key-block’.  See also the option
     ‘--auto-key-import’.

‘--personal-cipher-preferences STRING’
     Set the list of personal cipher preferences to STRING.  Use ‘gpg
     --version’ to get a list of available algorithms, and use ‘none’ to
     set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override
     the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will
     only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The
     most highly ranked cipher in this list is also used for the
     ‘--symmetric’ encryption command.

‘--personal-digest-preferences STRING’
     Set the list of personal digest preferences to STRING.  Use ‘gpg
     --version’ to get a list of available algorithms, and use ‘none’ to
     set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override
     the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will
     only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The
     most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list is also used when
     signing without encryption (e.g.  ‘--clear-sign’ or ‘--sign’).

‘--personal-compress-preferences STRING’
     Set the list of personal compression preferences to STRING.  Use
     ‘gpg --version’ to get a list of available algorithms, and use
     ‘none’ to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely
     override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as
     GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.
     The most highly ranked compression algorithm in this list is also
     used when there are no recipient keys to consider (e.g.
     ‘--symmetric’).

‘--s2k-cipher-algo NAME’
     Use NAME as the cipher algorithm for symmetric encryption with a
     passphrase if ‘--personal-cipher-preferences’ and ‘--cipher-algo’
     are not given.  The default is AES-128.

‘--s2k-digest-algo NAME’
     Use NAME as the digest algorithm used to mangle the passphrases for
     symmetric encryption.  The default is SHA-1.

‘--s2k-mode N’
     Selects how passphrases for symmetric encryption are mangled.  If N
     is 0 a plain passphrase (which is in general not recommended) will
     be used, a 1 adds a salt (which should not be used) to the
     passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a
     number of times (see ‘--s2k-count’).

‘--s2k-count N’
     Specify how many times the passphrases mangling for symmetric
     encryption is repeated.  This value may range between 1024 and
     65011712 inclusive.  The default is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note
     that not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an
     illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal
     value.  This option is only meaningful if ‘--s2k-mode’ is set to
     the default of 3.

4.2.5 Compliance options
------------------------

These options control what GnuPG is compliant to.  Only one of these
options may be active at a time.  Note that the default setting of this
is nearly always the correct one.  See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER
OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these options.

‘--gnupg’
     Use standard GnuPG behavior.  This is essentially OpenPGP behavior
     (see ‘--openpgp’), but with extension from the proposed update to
     OpenPGP and with some additional workarounds for common
     compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is the
     default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be useful
     to override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.

‘--openpgp’
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict OpenPGP
     behavior.  This option implies ‘--allow-old-cipher-algos’.  Use
     this option to reset all previous options like ‘--s2k-*’,
     ‘--cipher-algo’, ‘--digest-algo’ and ‘--compress-algo’ to OpenPGP
     compliant values.  All PGP workarounds are disabled.

‘--rfc4880’
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-4880
     behavior.  This option implies ‘--allow-old-cipher-algos’.  Note
     that this is currently the same thing as ‘--openpgp’.

‘--rfc4880bis’
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict according to
     the proposed updates of RFC-4880.

‘--rfc2440’
     Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-2440
     behavior.  Note that by using this option encryption packets are
     created in a legacy mode without MDC protection.  This is dangerous
     and should thus only be used for experiments.  This option implies
     ‘--allow-old-cipher-algos’.  See also option ‘--ignore-mdc-error’.

‘--pgp6’
     This option is obsolete; it is handled as an alias for ‘--pgp7’

‘--pgp7’
     Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible.  This
     allowed the ciphers IDEA, 3DES, CAST5,AES128, AES192, AES256, and
     TWOFISH., the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the compression
     algorithms none and ZIP. This option implies ‘--escape-from-lines’
     and disables ‘--throw-keyids’,

‘--pgp8’
     Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible.  PGP 8 is
     a lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions of PGP,
     so all this does is disable ‘--throw-keyids’ and set
     ‘--escape-from-lines’.  All algorithms are allowed except for the
     SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 digests.

‘--compliance STRING’
     This option can be used instead of one of the options above.  Valid
     values for STRING are the above option names (without the double
     dash) and possibly others as shown when using &quot;help&quot; for STRING.

‘--min-rsa-length N’
     This option adjusts the compliance mode &quot;de-vs&quot; for stricter key
     size requirements.  For example, a value of 3000 turns rsa2048 and
     dsa2048 keys into non-VS-NfD compliant keys.

‘--require-compliance’
     To check that data has been encrypted according to the rules of the
     current compliance mode, a gpg user needs to evaluate the status
     lines.  This is allows frontends to handle compliance check in a
     more flexible way.  However, for scripted use the required
     evaluation of the status-line requires quite some effort; this
     option can be used instead to make sure that the gpg process exits
     with a failure if the compliance rules are not fulfilled.  Note
     that this option has currently an effect only in &quot;de-vs&quot; mode.

4.2.6 Doing things one usually doesn&#39;t want to do
-------------------------------------------------

‘-n’
‘--dry-run’
     Don&#39;t make any changes (this is not completely implemented).

‘--list-only’
     Changes the behaviour of some commands.  This is like ‘--dry-run’
     but different in some cases.  The semantic of this option may be
     extended in the future.  Currently it only skips the actual
     decryption pass and therefore enables a fast listing of the
     encryption keys.

‘-i’
‘--interactive’
     Prompt before overwriting any files.

‘--compatibility-flags FLAGS’
     Set compatibility flags to work around problems due to
     non-compliant keys or data.  The FLAGS are given as a comma
     separated list of flag names and are OR-ed together.  The special
     flag &quot;none&quot; clears the list and allows one to start over with an
     empty list.  To get a list of available flags the sole word &quot;help&quot;
     can be used.

‘--debug-level LEVEL’
     Select the debug level for investigating problems.  LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or by a keyword:

     ‘none’
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of the keyword.
     ‘basic’
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘advanced’
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘expert’
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘guru’
          All of the debug messages you can get.  A value greater than 8
          may be used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program.  They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

‘--debug FLAGS’
     Set debug flags.  All flags are or-ed and FLAGS may be given in C
     syntax (e.g.  0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.
     To get a list of all supported flags the single word &quot;help&quot; can be
     used.  This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior
     may change at any time without notice.

‘--debug-all’
     Set all useful debugging flags.

‘--debug-iolbf’
     Set stdout into line buffered mode.  This option is only honored
     when given on the command line.

‘--debug-set-iobuf-size N’
     Change the buffer size of the IOBUFs to N kilobyte.  Using 0 prints
     the current size.  Note well: This is a maintainer only option and
     may thus be changed or removed at any time without notice.

‘--debug-allow-large-chunks’
     To facilitate software tests and experiments this option allows one
     to specify a limit of up to 4 EiB (‘--chunk-size 62’).

‘--debug-ignore-expiration’
     This option tries to override certain key expiration dates.  It is
     only useful for certain regression tests.

‘--faked-system-time EPOCH’
     This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time
     back or forth to EPOCH which is the number of seconds elapsed since
     the year 1970.  Alternatively EPOCH may be given as a full ISO time
     string (e.g.  &quot;20070924T154812&quot;).

     If you suffix EPOCH with an exclamation mark (!), the system time
     will appear to be frozen at the specified time.

‘--full-timestrings’
     Change the format of printed creation and expiration times from
     just the date to the date and time.  This is in general not useful
     and the same information is anyway available in ‘--with-colons’
     mode.  These longer strings are also not well aligned with other
     printed data.

‘--enable-progress-filter’
     Enable certain PROGRESS status outputs.  This option allows
     frontends to display a progress indicator while gpg is processing
     larger files.  There is a slight performance overhead using it.

‘--status-fd N’
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  See the
     file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

‘--status-file FILE’
     Same as ‘--status-fd’, except the status data is written to file
     FILE.

‘--logger-fd N’
     Write log output to file descriptor N and not to STDERR.

‘--log-file FILE’
‘--logger-file FILE’
     Same as ‘--logger-fd’, except the logger data is written to file
     FILE.  Use ‘socket://’ to log to s socket.

‘--log-time’
     Prefix all log output with a timestamp even if no log file is used.

‘--attribute-fd N’
     Write attribute subpackets to the file descriptor N.  This is most
     useful for use with ‘--status-fd’, since the status messages are
     needed to separate out the various subpackets from the stream
     delivered to the file descriptor.

‘--attribute-file FILE’
     Same as ‘--attribute-fd’, except the attribute data is written to
     file FILE.

‘--comment STRING’
‘--no-comments’
     Use STRING as a comment string in cleartext signatures and ASCII
     armored messages or keys (see ‘--armor’).  The default behavior is
     not to use a comment string.  ‘--comment’ may be repeated multiple
     times to get multiple comment strings.  ‘--no-comments’ removes all
     comments.  It is a good idea to keep the length of a single comment
     below 60 characters to avoid problems with mail programs wrapping
     such lines.  Note that comment lines, like all other header lines,
     are not protected by the signature.

‘--emit-version’
‘--no-emit-version’
     Force inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored output.  If
     given once only the name of the program and the major number is
     emitted, given twice the minor is also emitted, given thrice the
     micro is added, and given four times an operating system
     identification is also emitted.  ‘--no-emit-version’ (default)
     disables the version line.

‘--sig-notation {NAME=VALUE}’
‘--cert-notation {NAME=VALUE}’
‘-N, --set-notation {NAME=VALUE}’
     Put the name value pair into the signature as notation data.  NAME
     must consist only of printable characters or spaces, and must
     contain a &#39;@&#39; character in the form keyname@domain.example.com
     (substituting the appropriate keyname and domain name, of course).
     This is to help prevent pollution of the IETF reserved notation
     namespace.  The ‘--expert’ flag overrides the &#39;@&#39; check.  VALUE may
     be any printable string; it will be encoded in UTF-8, so you should
     check that your ‘--display-charset’ is set correctly.  If you
     prefix NAME with an exclamation mark (!), the notation data will be
     flagged as critical (rfc4880:5.2.3.16).  ‘--sig-notation’ sets a
     notation for data signatures.  ‘--cert-notation’ sets a notation
     for key signatures (certifications).  ‘--set-notation’ sets both.

     There are special codes that may be used in notation names.  &quot;%k&quot;
     will be expanded into the key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%K&quot; into
     the long key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%f&quot; into the fingerprint
     of the key being signed, &quot;%s&quot; into the key ID of the key making the
     signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long key ID of the key making the
     signature, &quot;%g&quot; into the fingerprint of the key making the
     signature (which might be a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the fingerprint of
     the primary key of the key making the signature, &quot;%c&quot; into the
     signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and &quot;%%&quot; results in a
     single &quot;%&quot;.  %k, %K, and %f are only meaningful when making a key
     signature (certification), and %c is only meaningful when using the
     OpenPGP smartcard.

‘--known-notation NAME’
     Adds NAME to a list of known critical signature notations.  The
     effect of this is that gpg will not mark a signature with a
     critical signature notation of that name as bad.  Note that gpg
     already knows by default about a few critical signatures notation
     names.

‘--sig-policy-url STRING’
‘--cert-policy-url STRING’
‘--set-policy-url STRING’
     Use STRING as a Policy URL for signatures (rfc4880:5.2.3.20).  If
     you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet
     will be flagged as critical.  ‘--sig-policy-url’ sets a policy url
     for data signatures.  ‘--cert-policy-url’ sets a policy url for key
     signatures (certifications).  ‘--set-policy-url’ sets both.

     The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as
     well.

‘--sig-keyserver-url STRING’
     Use STRING as a preferred keyserver URL for data signatures.  If
     you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the keyserver URL
     packet will be flagged as critical.

     The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as
     well.

‘--set-filename STRING’
     Use STRING as the filename which is stored inside messages.  This
     overrides the default, which is to use the actual filename of the
     file being encrypted.  Using the empty string for STRING
     effectively removes the filename from the output.

‘--for-your-eyes-only’
‘--no-for-your-eyes-only’
     Set the &#39;for your eyes only&#39; flag in the message.  This causes
     GnuPG to refuse to save the file unless the ‘--output’ option is
     given, and PGP to use a &quot;secure viewer&quot; with a claimed
     Tempest-resistant font to display the message.  This option
     overrides ‘--set-filename’.  ‘--no-for-your-eyes-only’ disables
     this option.

‘--use-embedded-filename’
‘--no-use-embedded-filename’
     Try to create a file with a name as embedded in the data.  This can
     be a dangerous option as it enables overwriting files.  Defaults to
     no.  Note that the option ‘--output’ overrides this option.

‘--cipher-algo NAME’
     Use NAME as cipher algorithm.  Running the program with the command
     ‘--version’ yields a list of supported algorithms.  If this is not
     used the cipher algorithm is selected from the preferences stored
     with the key.  In general, you do not want to use this option as it
     allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.  The option
     ‘--personal-cipher-preferences’ is the safe way to accomplish the
     same thing.

‘--digest-algo NAME’
     Use NAME as the message digest algorithm.  Running the program with
     the command ‘--version’ yields a list of supported algorithms.  In
     general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to
     violate the OpenPGP standard.  The option
     ‘--personal-digest-preferences’ is the safe way to accomplish the
     same thing.

‘--compress-algo NAME’
     Use compression algorithm NAME.  &quot;zlib&quot; is RFC-1950 ZLIB
     compression.  &quot;zip&quot; is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by
     PGP. &quot;bzip2&quot; is a more modern compression scheme that can compress
     some things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of more memory
     used during compression and decompression.  &quot;uncompressed&quot; or
     &quot;none&quot; disables compression.  If this option is not used, the
     default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see
     which algorithms the recipient supports.  If all else fails, ZIP is
     used for maximum compatibility.

     ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the
     compression window size is not limited to 8k.  BZIP2 may give even
     better compression results than that, but will use a significantly
     larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing.  This
     may be significant in low memory situations.  Note, however, that
     PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP compression.  Using any
     algorithm other than ZIP or &quot;none&quot; will make the message unreadable
     with PGP. In general, you do not want to use this option as it
     allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.  The option
     ‘--personal-compress-preferences’ is the safe way to accomplish the
     same thing.

‘--cert-digest-algo NAME’
     Use NAME as the message digest algorithm used when signing a key.
     Running the program with the command ‘--version’ yields a list of
     supported algorithms.  Be aware that if you choose an algorithm
     that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then
     some users will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or
     quite possibly your entire key.  Note also that a public key
     algorithm must be compatible with the specified digest algorithm;
     thus selecting an arbitrary digest algorithm may result in error
     messages from lower crypto layers or lead to security flaws.

‘--disable-cipher-algo NAME’
     Never allow the use of NAME as cipher algorithm.  The given name
     will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will still get
     disabled.

‘--disable-pubkey-algo NAME’
     Never allow the use of NAME as public key algorithm.  The given
     name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will
     still get disabled.

‘--throw-keyids’
‘--no-throw-keyids’
     Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages.  This
     helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a limited
     countermeasure against traffic analysis.(1)  On the receiving side,
     it may slow down the decryption process because all available
     secret keys must be tried.  ‘--no-throw-keyids’ disables this
     option.  This option is essentially the same as using
     ‘--hidden-recipient’ for all recipients.

‘--not-dash-escaped’
     This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that
     they can be used for patch files.  You should not send such an
     armored file via email because all spaces and line endings are
     hashed too.  You can not use this option for data which has 5
     dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files don&#39;t have this.  A
     special armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext
     signature option.

‘--escape-from-lines’
‘--no-escape-from-lines’
     Because some mailers change lines starting with &quot;From &quot; to &quot;&gt;From &quot;
     it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
     cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking the
     signature.  Note that all other PGP versions do it this way too.
     Enabled by default.  ‘--no-escape-from-lines’ disables this option.

‘--passphrase-repeat N’
     Specify how many times ‘gpg’ will request a new passphrase be
     repeated.  This is useful for helping memorize a passphrase.
     Defaults to 1 repetition; can be set to 0 to disable any passphrase
     repetition.  Note that a N greater than 1 will pop up the pinentry
     window N+1 times even if a modern pinentry with two entry fields is
     used.

‘--passphrase-fd N’
     Read the passphrase from file descriptor N.  Only the first line
     will be read from file descriptor N.  If you use 0 for N, the
     passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if only
     one passphrase is supplied.

     Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the
     option ‘--batch’ has also been given.  Since Version 2.1 the
     ‘--pinentry-mode’ also needs to be set to ‘loopback’.

‘--passphrase-file FILE’
     Read the passphrase from file FILE.  Only the first line will be
     read from file FILE.  This can only be used if only one passphrase
     is supplied.  Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is of
     questionable security if other users can read this file.  Don&#39;t use
     this option if you can avoid it.

     Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the
     option ‘--batch’ has also been given.  Since Version 2.1 the
     ‘--pinentry-mode’ also needs to be set to ‘loopback’.

‘--passphrase STRING’
     Use STRING as the passphrase.  This can only be used if only one
     passphrase is supplied.  Obviously, this is of very questionable
     security on a multi-user system.  Don&#39;t use this option if you can
     avoid it.

     Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if the
     option ‘--batch’ has also been given.  Since Version 2.1 the
     ‘--pinentry-mode’ also needs to be set to ‘loopback’.

‘--pinentry-mode MODE’
     Set the pinentry mode to MODE.  Allowed values for MODE are:
     default
          Use the default of the agent, which is ‘ask’.
     ask
          Force the use of the Pinentry.
     cancel
          Emulate use of Pinentry&#39;s cancel button.
     error
          Return a Pinentry error (&quot;No Pinentry&quot;).
     loopback
          Redirect Pinentry queries to the caller.  Note that in
          contrast to Pinentry the user is not prompted again if he
          enters a bad password.

‘--no-symkey-cache’
     Disable the passphrase cache used for symmetrical en- and
     decryption.  This cache is based on the message specific salt value
     (cf.  ‘--s2k-mode’).

‘--request-origin ORIGIN’
     Tell gpg to assume that the operation ultimately originated at
     ORIGIN.  Depending on the origin certain restrictions are applied
     and the Pinentry may include an extra note on the origin.
     Supported values for ORIGIN are: ‘local’ which is the default,
     ‘remote’ to indicate a remote origin or ‘browser’ for an operation
     requested by a web browser.

‘--command-fd N’
     This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC mode.
     If this option is enabled, user input on questions is not expected
     from the TTY but from the given file descriptor.  It should be used
     together with ‘--status-fd’.  See the file doc/DETAILS in the
     source distribution for details on how to use it.

‘--command-file FILE’
     Same as ‘--command-fd’, except the commands are read out of file
     FILE

‘--allow-non-selfsigned-uid’
‘--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid’
     Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not
     self-signed.  This is not recommended, as a non self-signed user ID
     is trivial to forge.  ‘--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid’ disables.

‘--allow-freeform-uid’
     Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a
     new one.  This option should only be used in very special
     environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of
     user IDs.

‘--ignore-time-conflict’
     GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
     signatures have plausible values.  However, sometimes a signature
     seems to be older than the key due to clock problems.  This option
     makes these checks just a warning.  See also ‘--ignore-valid-from’
     for timestamp issues on subkeys.

‘--ignore-valid-from’
     GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the
     future.  This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits
     the pre-1.0.7 behaviour.  You should not use this option unless
     there is some clock problem.  See also ‘--ignore-time-conflict’ for
     timestamp issues with signatures.

‘--ignore-crc-error’
     The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum
     against transmission errors.  Occasionally the CRC gets mangled
     somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual content (which
     is protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay.  This
     option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.

‘--ignore-mdc-error’
     This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a
     warning.  It is required to decrypt old messages which did not use
     an MDC. It may also be useful if a message is partially garbled,
     but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of that
     garbled message.  Be aware that a missing or failed MDC can be an
     indication of an attack.  Use with great caution; see also option
     ‘--rfc2440’.

‘--allow-old-cipher-algos’
     Old cipher algorithms like 3DES, IDEA, or CAST5 encrypt data using
     blocks of 64 bits; modern algorithms use blocks of 128 bit instead.
     To avoid certain attack on these old algorithms it is suggested not
     to encrypt more than 150 MiByte using the same key.  For this
     reason gpg does not allow the use of 64 bit block size algorithms
     for encryption unless this option is specified.

‘--allow-weak-digest-algos’
     Signatures made with known-weak digest algorithms are normally
     rejected with an &quot;invalid digest algorithm&quot; message.  This option
     allows the verification of signatures made with such weak
     algorithms.  MD5 is the only digest algorithm considered weak by
     default.  See also ‘--weak-digest’ to reject other digest
     algorithms.

‘--weak-digest NAME’
     Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.  Signatures made over
     weak digests algorithms are normally rejected.  This option can be
     supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be considered
     weak.  See also ‘--allow-weak-digest-algos’ to disable rejection of
     weak digests.  MD5 is always considered weak, and does not need to
     be listed explicitly.

‘--allow-weak-key-signatures’
     To avoid a minor risk of collision attacks on third-party key
     signatures made using SHA-1, those key signatures are considered
     invalid.  This options allows one to override this restriction.

‘--override-compliance-check’
     This was a temporary introduced option and has no more effect.

‘--no-default-keyring’
     Do not add the default keyring to the list of keyrings.  Note that
     GnuPG needs for almost all operations a keyring.  Thus if you use
     this option and do not provide alternate keyrings via ‘--keyring’,
     then GnuPG will still use the default keyring.

     Note that if the option ‘use-keyboxd’ is enabled in ‘common.conf’,
     no keyrings are used at all and keys are all maintained by the
     keyboxd process in its own database.

‘--no-keyring’
     Do not use any keyring at all.  This overrides the default and all
     options which specify keyrings.

‘--skip-verify’
     Skip the signature verification step.  This may be used to make the
     decryption faster if the signature verification is not needed.

‘--with-key-data’
     Print key listings delimited by colons (like ‘--with-colons’) and
     print the public key data.

‘--list-signatures’
‘--list-sigs’
     Same as ‘--list-keys’, but the signatures are listed too.  This
     command has the same effect as using ‘--list-keys’ with
     ‘--with-sig-list’.  Note that in contrast to ‘--check-signatures’
     the key signatures are not verified.  This command can be used to
     create a list of signing keys missing in the local keyring; for
     example:

                gpg --list-sigs --with-colons USERID | \
                  awk -F: &#39;$1==&quot;sig&quot; &amp;&amp; $2==&quot;?&quot; {if($13){print $13}else{print $5}}&#39;

‘--fast-list-mode’
     Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is
     achieved by leaving some parts empty.  Some applications don&#39;t need
     the user ID and the trust information given in the listings.  By
     using this options they can get a faster listing.  The exact
     behaviour of this option may change in future versions.  If you are
     missing some information, don&#39;t use this option.

‘--no-literal’
     This is not for normal use.  Use the source to see for what it
     might be useful.

‘--set-filesize’
     This is not for normal use.  Use the source to see for what it
     might be useful.

‘--show-session-key’
     Display the session key used for one message.  See
     ‘--override-session-key’ for the counterpart of this option.

     We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should
     have the freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the
     content of one specific message without compromising all messages
     ever encrypted for one secret key.

     You can also use this option if you receive an encrypted message
     which is abusive or offensive, to prove to the administrators of
     the messaging system that the ciphertext transmitted corresponds to
     an inappropriate plaintext so they can take action against the
     offending user.

‘--override-session-key STRING’
‘--override-session-key-fd FD’
     Don&#39;t use the public key but the session key STRING respective the
     session key taken from the first line read from file descriptor FD.
     The format of this string is the same as the one printed by
     ‘--show-session-key’.  This option is normally not used but comes
     handy in case someone forces you to reveal the content of an
     encrypted message; using this option you can do this without
     handing out the secret key.  Note that using
     ‘--override-session-key’ may reveal the session key to all local
     users via the global process table.  Often it is useful to combine
     this option with ‘--no-keyring’.

‘--ask-sig-expire’
‘--no-ask-sig-expire’
     When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time.  If
     this option is not specified, the expiration time set via
     ‘--default-sig-expire’ is used.  ‘--no-ask-sig-expire’ disables
     this option.

‘--default-sig-expire’
     The default expiration time to use for signature expiration.  Valid
     values are &quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d
     (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for
     example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five years), or an
     absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &quot;0&quot;.

‘--ask-cert-expire’
‘--no-ask-cert-expire’
     When making a key signature, prompt for an expiration time.  If
     this option is not specified, the expiration time set via
     ‘--default-cert-expire’ is used.  ‘--no-ask-cert-expire’ disables
     this option.

‘--default-cert-expire’
     The default expiration time to use for key signature expiration.
     Valid values are &quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number followed by the
     letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for
     years) (for example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five years),
     or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to &quot;0&quot;.

‘--default-new-key-algo STRING’
     This option can be used to change the default algorithms for key
     generation.  The STRING is similar to the arguments required for
     the command ‘--quick-add-key’ but slightly different.  For example
     the current default of ‘&quot;rsa2048/cert,sign+rsa2048/encr&quot;’ (or
     ‘&quot;rsa3072&quot;’) can be changed to the value of what we currently call
     future default, which is ‘&quot;ed25519/cert,sign+cv25519/encr&quot;’.  You
     need to consult the source code to learn the details.  Note that
     the advanced key generation commands can always be used to specify
     a key algorithm directly.

‘--no-auto-trust-new-key’
     When creating a new key the ownertrust of the new key is set to
     ultimate.  This option disables this and the user needs to manually
     assign an ownertrust value.

‘--force-sign-key’
     This option modifies the behaviour of the commands
     ‘--quick-sign-key’, ‘--quick-lsign-key’, and the &quot;sign&quot;
     sub-commands of ‘--edit-key’ by forcing the creation of a key
     signature, even if one already exists.

‘--forbid-gen-key’
     This option is intended for use in the global config file to
     disallow the use of generate key commands.  Those commands will
     then fail with the error code for Not Enabled.

‘--allow-secret-key-import’
     This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.

‘--allow-multiple-messages’
‘--no-allow-multiple-messages’
     These are obsolete options; they have no more effect since GnuPG
     2.2.8.

‘--enable-special-filenames’
     This option enables a mode in which filenames of the form ‘-&amp;n’,
     where n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the file
     descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

‘--no-expensive-trust-checks’
     Experimental use only.

‘--preserve-permissions’
     Don&#39;t change the permissions of a secret keyring back to user
     read/write only.  Use this option only if you really know what you
     are doing.

‘--default-preference-list STRING’
     Set the list of default preferences to STRING.  This preference
     list is used for new keys and becomes the default for &quot;setpref&quot; in
     the ‘--edit-key’ menu.

‘--default-keyserver-url NAME’
     Set the default keyserver URL to NAME.  This keyserver will be used
     as the keyserver URL when writing a new self-signature on a key,
     which includes key generation and changing preferences.

‘--list-config’
     Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG. This
     option is intended for external programs that call GnuPG to perform
     tasks, and is thus not generally useful.  See the file
     ‘doc/DETAILS’ in the source distribution for the details of which
     configuration items may be listed.  ‘--list-config’ is only usable
     with ‘--with-colons’ set.

‘--list-gcrypt-config’
     Display various internal configuration parameters of Libgcrypt.

‘--gpgconf-list’
     This command is similar to ‘--list-config’ but in general only
     internally used by the ‘gpgconf’ tool.

‘--gpgconf-test’
     This is more or less dummy action.  However it parses the
     configuration file and returns with failure if the configuration
     file would prevent ‘gpg’ from startup.  Thus it may be used to run
     a syntax check on the configuration file.

‘--chuid UID’
     Change the current user to UID which may either be a number or a
     name.  This can be used from the root account to run gpg for
     another user.  If UID is not the current UID a standard PATH is set
     and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the
     option ‘--homedir’ can be used.  This option has only an effect
     when used on the command line.  This option has currently no effect
     at all on Windows.

4.3 Configuration files
=======================

There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of
‘gpg’&#39;s operation.  Unless noted, they are expected in the current home
directory (*note option --homedir::).

‘gpg.conf’
     This is the standard configuration file read by ‘gpg’ on startup.
     It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes may
     not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This default
     name may be changed on the command line (*note gpg-option
     --options::).  You should backup this file.

‘common.conf’
     This is an optional configuration file read by ‘gpg’ on startup.
     It may contain options pertaining to all components of GnuPG. Its
     current main use is for the &quot;use-keyboxd&quot; option.  If the default
     home directory ‘~/.gnupg’ does not exist, GnuPG creates this
     directory and a ‘common.conf’ file with &quot;use_keyboxd&quot;.

   Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined
files into the directory ‘/etc/skel/.gnupg’ so that newly created users
start up with a working configuration.  For existing users a small
helper script is provided to create these files (*note addgnupghome::).

   For internal purposes ‘gpg’ creates and maintains a few other files;
They all live in the current home directory (*note option --homedir::).
Only the ‘gpg’ program may modify these files.

‘~/.gnupg’
     This is the default home directory which is used if neither the
     environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’ nor the option ‘--homedir’ is
     given.

‘~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg’
     The public keyring using a legacy format.  You should backup this
     file.

     If this file is not available, ‘gpg’ defaults to the new keybox
     format and creates a file ‘pubring.kbx’ unless that file already
     exists in which case that file will also be used for OpenPGP keys.

     Note that in the case that both files, ‘pubring.gpg’ and
     ‘pubring.kbx’ exists but the latter has no OpenPGP keys, the legacy
     file ‘pubring.gpg’ will be used.  Take care: GnuPG versions before
     2.1 will always use the file ‘pubring.gpg’ because they do not know
     about the new keybox format.  In the case that you have to use
     GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data you should keep this file.

‘~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock’
     The lock file for the public keyring.

‘~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx’
     The public keyring using the new keybox format.  This file is
     shared with ‘gpgsm’.  You should backup this file.  See above for
     the relation between this file and it predecessor.

     To convert an existing ‘pubring.gpg’ file to the keybox format, you
     first backup the ownertrust values, then rename ‘pubring.gpg’ to
     ‘publickeys.backup’, so it won’t be recognized by any GnuPG
     version, run import, and finally restore the ownertrust values:

            $ cd ~/.gnupg
            $ gpg --export-ownertrust &gt;otrust.lst
            $ mv pubring.gpg publickeys.backup
            $ gpg --import-options restore --import publickeys.backup
            $ gpg --import-ownertrust otrust.lst

‘~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock’
     The lock file for ‘pubring.kbx’.

‘~/.gnupg/secring.gpg’
     The legacy secret keyring as used by GnuPG versions before 2.1.  It
     is not used by GnuPG 2.1 and later.  You may want to keep it in
     case you have to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data.

‘~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock’
     The lock file for the legacy secret keyring.

‘~/.gnupg/.gpg-v21-migrated’
     File indicating that a migration to GnuPG 2.1 has been done.

‘~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg’
     The trust database.  There is no need to backup this file; it is
     better to backup the ownertrust values (*note option
     --export-ownertrust::).

‘~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock’
     The lock file for the trust database.

‘~/.gnupg/random_seed’
     A file used to preserve the state of the internal random pool.

‘~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/’
     This is the directory where gpg stores pre-generated revocation
     certificates.  The file name corresponds to the OpenPGP fingerprint
     of the respective key.  It is suggested to backup those
     certificates and if the primary private key is not stored on the
     disk to move them to an external storage device.  Anyone who can
     access these files is able to revoke the corresponding key.  You
     may want to print them out.  You should backup all files in this
     directory and take care to keep this backup closed away.

   Operation is further controlled by a few environment variables:

HOME
     Used to locate the default home directory.

GNUPGHOME
     If set directory used instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.

GPG_AGENT_INFO
     This variable is obsolete; it was used by GnuPG versions before
     2.1.

PINENTRY_USER_DATA
     This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry.  It is useful to
     convey extra information to a custom pinentry.

COLUMNS
LINES
     Used to size some displays to the full size of the screen.

LANGUAGE
     Apart from its use by GNU, it is used in the W32 version to
     override the language selection done through the Registry.  If used
     and set to a valid and available language name (LANGID), the file
     with the translation is loaded from ‘GPGDIR/gnupg.nls/LANGID.mo’.
     Here GPGDIR is the directory out of which the gpg binary has been
     loaded.  If it can&#39;t be loaded the Registry is tried and as last
     resort the native Windows locale system is used.

GNUPG_BUILD_ROOT
     This variable is only used by the regression test suite as a helper
     under operating systems without proper support to figure out the
     name of a process&#39; text file.

GNUPG_EXEC_DEBUG_FLAGS
     This variable allows one to enable diagnostics for process
     management.  A numeric decimal value is expected.  Bit 0 enables
     general diagnostics, bit 1 enables certain warnings on Windows.

   When calling the gpg-agent component ‘gpg’ sends a set of environment
variables to gpg-agent.  The names of these variables can be listed
using the command:

       gpg-connect-agent &#39;getinfo std_env_names&#39; /bye | awk &#39;$1==&quot;D&quot; {print $2}&#39;

4.4 Examples
============

gpg -se -r ‘Bob’ ‘file’
     sign and encrypt for user Bob

gpg -clear-sign ‘file’
     make a cleartext signature

gpg -sb ‘file’
     make a detached signature

gpg -u 0x12345678 -sb ‘file’
     make a detached signature with the key 0x12345678

gpg -list-keys ‘user_ID’
     show keys

gpg -fingerprint ‘user_ID’
     show fingerprint

gpg -verify ‘pgpfile’
gpg -verify ‘sigfile’ [‘datafile’]
     Verify the signature of the file but do not output the data unless
     requested.  The second form is used for detached signatures, where
     ‘sigfile’ is the detached signature (either ASCII armored or
     binary) and ‘datafile’ are the signed data; if this is not given,
     the name of the file holding the signed data is constructed by
     cutting off the extension (&quot;.asc&quot; or &quot;.sig&quot;) of ‘sigfile’ or by
     asking the user for the filename.  If the option ‘--output’ is also
     used the signed data is written to the file specified by that
     option; use ‘-’ to write the signed data to stdout.

FILTER EXPRESSIONS
******************

The options ‘--import-filter’ and ‘--export-filter’ use expressions with
this syntax (square brackets indicate an optional part and curly braces
a repetition, white space between the elements are allowed):

       [lc] {[{flag}] PROPNAME op VALUE [lc]}

   The name of a property (PROPNAME) may only consist of letters, digits
and underscores.  The description for the filter type describes which
properties are defined.  If an undefined property is used it evaluates
to the empty string.  Unless otherwise noted, the VALUE must always be
given and may not be the empty string.  No quoting is defined for the
value, thus the value may not contain the strings ‘&amp;&amp;’ or ‘||’, which
are used as logical connection operators.  The flag ‘--’ can be used to
remove this restriction.

   Numerical values are computed as long int; standard C notation
applies.  LC is the logical connection operator; either ‘&amp;&amp;’ for a
conjunction or ‘||’ for a disjunction.  A conjunction is assumed at the
begin of an expression.  Conjunctions have higher precedence than
disjunctions.  If VALUE starts with one of the characters used in any OP
a space after the OP is required.

The supported operators (OP) are:

=~
     Substring must match.

!~
     Substring must not match.

=
     The full string must match.

&lt;&gt;
     The full string must not match.

==
     The numerical value must match.

!=
     The numerical value must not match.

&lt;=
     The numerical value of the field must be LE than the value.

&lt;
     The numerical value of the field must be LT than the value.

&gt;
     The numerical value of the field must be GT than the value.

&gt;=
     The numerical value of the field must be GE than the value.

-le
     The string value of the field must be less or equal than the value.

-lt
     The string value of the field must be less than the value.

-gt
     The string value of the field must be greater than the value.

-ge
     The string value of the field must be greater or equal than the
     value.

-n
     True if value is not empty (no value allowed).

-z
     True if value is empty (no value allowed).

-t
     Alias for &quot;PROPNAME != 0&quot; (no value allowed).

-f
     Alias for &quot;PROPNAME == 0&quot; (no value allowed).

Values for FLAG must be space separated.  The supported flags are:

-
     VALUE spans to the end of the expression.
-c
     The string match in this part is done case-sensitive.
-t
     Leading and trailing spaces are not removed from VALUE.  The
     optional single space after OP is here required.

   The filter options concatenate several specifications for a filter of
the same type.  For example the four options in this example:

      --import-filter keep-uid=&quot;uid =~ Alfa&quot;
      --import-filter keep-uid=&quot;&amp;&amp; uid !~ Test&quot;
      --import-filter keep-uid=&quot;|| uid =~ Alpha&quot;
      --import-filter keep-uid=&quot;uid !~ Test&quot;

which is equivalent to

      --import-filter \
       keep-uid=&quot;uid =~ Alfa&quot; &amp;&amp; uid !~ Test&quot; || uid =~ Alpha&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;uid !~ Test&quot;

   imports only the user ids of a key containing the strings &quot;Alfa&quot; or
&quot;Alpha&quot; but not the string &quot;test&quot;.

RETURN VALUE
************

The program returns 0 if there are no severe errors, 1 if at least a
signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

   Note that signature verification requires exact knowledge of what has
been signed and by whom it has been signed.  Using only the return code
is thus not an appropriate way to verify a signature by a script.
Either make proper use or the status codes or use the ‘gpgv’ tool which
has been designed to make signature verification easy for scripts.

WARNINGS
********

Use a good password for your user account and make sure that all
security issues are always fixed on your machine.  Also employ diligent
physical protection to your machine.  Consider to use a good passphrase
as a last resort protection to your secret key in the case your machine
gets stolen.  It is important that your secret key is never leaked.
Using an easy to carry around token or smartcard with the secret key is
often a advisable.

   If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line
or use ‘-’ to specify STDIN.

   For scripted or other unattended use of ‘gpg’ make sure to use the
machine-parseable interface and not the default interface which is
intended for direct use by humans.  The machine-parseable interface
provides a stable and well documented API independent of the locale or
future changes of ‘gpg’.  To enable this interface use the options
‘--with-colons’ and ‘--status-fd’.  For certain operations the option
‘--command-fd’ may come handy too.  See this man page and the file
‘DETAILS’ for the specification of the interface.  Note that the GnuPG
&quot;info&quot; pages as well as the PDF version of the GnuPG manual features a
chapter on unattended use of GnuPG. As an alternative the library
‘GPGME’ can be used as a high-level abstraction on top of that
interface.

INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS
********************************************

GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP
standard.  In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of
the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2
compression algorithms.  It is important to be aware that not all
OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by forcing
their use via the ‘--cipher-algo’, ‘--digest-algo’,
‘--cert-digest-algo’, or ‘--compress-algo’ options in GnuPG, it is
possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that
cannot be read by the intended recipient.

   There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and
each supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms.
For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported the
BLOWFISH cipher algorithm.  A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be
read by a PGP user.  By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
preferences system that will always do the right thing and create
messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP
program they use.  Only override this safe default if you really know
what you are doing.

   If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the
preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far
better off using the ‘--pgp6’, ‘--pgp7’, or ‘--pgp8’ options.  These
options are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in
violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a
&quot;PGP-safe&quot; list.

BUGS
****

On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root).  This
is necessary to lock memory pages.  Locking memory pages prevents the
operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain
passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk.  If you get no warning
message about insecure memory your operating system supports locking
without being root.  The program drops root privileges as soon as locked
memory is allocated.

   Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to
&quot;suspend to disk&quot; (also known as &quot;safe sleep&quot; or &quot;hibernate&quot;).  This
writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even powered
off mode.  Unless measures are taken in the operating system to protect
the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be
recoverable from it later.

   Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list
archives for similar problems and second check whether such a bug has
already been reported to our bug tracker at &lt;https://bugs.gnupg.org&gt;.

4.5 Unattended Usage
====================

‘gpg’ is often used as a backend engine by other software.  To help with
this a machine interface has been defined to have an unambiguous way to
do this.  The options ‘--status-fd’ and ‘--batch’ are almost always
required for this.

4.5.1 Programmatic use of GnuPG
-------------------------------

Please consider using GPGME instead of calling ‘gpg’ directly.  GPGME
offers a stable, backend-independent interface for many cryptographic
operations.  It supports OpenPGP and S/MIME, and also allows interaction
with various GnuPG components.

   GPGME provides a C-API, and comes with bindings for C++, Qt, and
Python.  Bindings for other languages are available.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Ephemeral home directories,  Next: The quick key manipulation interface,  Prev: Programmatic use of GnuPG,  Up: Unattended Usage of GPG

4.5.2 Ephemeral home directories
--------------------------------

Sometimes you want to contain effects of some operation, for example you
want to import a key to inspect it, but you do not want this key to be
added to your keyring.  In earlier versions of GnuPG, it was possible to
specify alternate keyring files for both public and secret keys.  In
modern GnuPG versions, however, we changed how secret keys are stored in
order to better protect secret key material, and it was not possible to
preserve this interface.

   The preferred way to do this is to use ephemeral home directories.
This technique works across all versions of GnuPG.

   Create a temporary directory, create (or copy) a configuration that
meets your needs, make ‘gpg’ use this directory either using the
environment variable GNUPGHOME, or the option ‘--homedir’.  GPGME
supports this too on a per-context basis, by modifying the engine info
of contexts.  Now execute whatever operation you like, import and export
key material as necessary.  Once finished, you can delete the directory.
All GnuPG backend services that were started will detect this and shut
down.

4.5.3 The quick key manipulation interface
------------------------------------------

Recent versions of GnuPG have an interface to manipulate keys without
using the interactive command ‘--edit-key’.  This interface was added
mainly for the benefit of GPGME (please consider using GPGME, see the
manual subsection &quot;Programmatic use of GnuPG&quot;). This interface is
described in the subsection &quot;How to manage your keys&quot;.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Unattended GPG key generation,  Prev: The quick key manipulation interface,  Up: Unattended Usage of GPG

4.5.4 Unattended key generation
-------------------------------

The command ‘--generate-key’ may be used along with the option ‘--batch’
for unattended key generation.  This is the most flexible way of
generating keys, but it is also the most complex one.  Consider using
the quick key manipulation interface described in the previous
subsection &quot;The quick key manipulation interface&quot;.

   The parameters for the key are either read from stdin or given as a
file on the command line.  The format of the parameter file is as
follows: Text only, line length is limited to about 1000 characters.
UTF-8 encoding must be used to specify non-ASCII characters.  Empty
lines are ignored.  Leading and trailing white space is ignored.  A hash
sign as the first non white space character indicates a comment line.
Control statements are indicated by a leading percent sign, their
arguments are separated by white space from the keyword.  Parameters are
specified by a keyword, followed by a colon; arguments are separated by
white space.  The first parameter must be ‘Key-Type’ but control
statements may be placed anywhere.  The order of the parameters does not
matter except for ‘Key-Type’.  The parameters are only used for the
generated keyblock (primary and subkeys); parameters from previous sets
are not used.  Some syntax checks may be performed.  Key commences when
either the end of the parameter file is reached, the next ‘Key-Type’
parameter is encountered, or the control statement ‘%commit’ is
encountered.

Control statements:

%echo TEXT
     Print TEXT as diagnostic.

%dry-run
     Suppress actual key generation (useful for syntax checking).

%commit
     Perform the key generation.  Note that an implicit commit is done
     at the next Key-Type parameter.

%pubring FILENAME
     Do not write the key to the default or commandline given keyring
     but to FILENAME.  This must be given before the first commit to
     take place, duplicate specification of the same filename is
     ignored, the last filename before a commit is used.  The filename
     is used until a new filename is used (at commit points) and all
     keys are written to that file.  If a new filename is given, this
     file is created (and overwrites an existing one).

     See the previous subsection &quot;Ephemeral home directories&quot; for a more
     robust way to contain side-effects.

%secring FILENAME
     This option is a no-op for GnuPG 2.1 and later.

     See the previous subsection &quot;Ephemeral home directories&quot;.

%ask-passphrase
%no-ask-passphrase
     This option is a no-op since GnuPG version 2.1.

%no-protection
     Using this option allows the creation of keys without any
     passphrase protection.  This option is mainly intended for
     regression tests.

%transient-key
     If given the keys are created using a faster and a somewhat less
     secure random number generator.  This option may be used for keys
     which are only used for a short time and do not require full
     cryptographic strength.  It takes only effect if used together with
     the control statement ‘%no-protection’.

General Parameters:

Key-Type: ALGO
     Starts a new parameter block by giving the type of the primary key.
     The algorithm must be capable of signing.  This is a required
     parameter.  ALGO may either be an OpenPGP algorithm number or a
     string with the algorithm name.  The special value ‘default’ may be
     used for ALGO to create the default key type; in this case a
     ‘Key-Usage’ shall not be given and ‘default’ also be used for
     ‘Subkey-Type’.

Key-Length: NBITS
     The requested length of the generated key in bits.  The default is
     returned by running the command ‘gpg --gpgconf-list’.  For ECC keys
     this parameter is ignored.

Key-Curve: CURVE
     The requested elliptic curve of the generated key.  This is a
     required parameter for ECC keys.  It is ignored for non-ECC keys.

Key-Grip: HEXSTRING
     This is optional and used to generate a CSR or certificate for an
     already existing key.  Key-Length will be ignored when given.

Key-Usage: USAGE-LIST
     Space or comma delimited list of key usages.  Allowed values are
     ‘encrypt’, ‘sign’, and ‘auth’.  This is used to generate the key
     flags.  Please make sure that the algorithm is capable of this
     usage.  Note that OpenPGP requires that all primary keys are
     capable of certification, so no matter what usage is given here,
     the ‘cert’ flag will be on.  If no ‘Key-Usage’ is specified and the
     ‘Key-Type’ is not ‘default’, all allowed usages for that particular
     algorithm are used; if it is not given but ‘default’ is used the
     usage will be ‘sign’.

Subkey-Type: ALGO
     This generates a secondary key (subkey).  Currently only one subkey
     can be handled.  See also ‘Key-Type’ above.

Subkey-Length: NBITS
     Length of the secondary key (subkey) in bits.  The default is
     returned by running the command ‘gpg --gpgconf-list’.

Subkey-Curve: CURVE
     Key curve for a subkey; similar to ‘Key-Curve’.

Subkey-Usage: USAGE-LIST
     Key usage lists for a subkey; similar to ‘Key-Usage’.

Passphrase: STRING
     If you want to specify a passphrase for the secret key, enter it
     here.  Default is to use the Pinentry dialog to ask for a
     passphrase.

Name-Real: NAME
Name-Comment: COMMENT
Name-Email: EMAIL
     The three parts of a user name.  Remember to use UTF-8 encoding
     here.  If you don&#39;t give any of them, no user ID is created.

Expire-Date: ISO-DATE|(NUMBER[d|w|m|y])
     Set the expiration date for the key (and the subkey).  It may
     either be entered in ISO date format (e.g.  &quot;20000815T145012&quot;) or
     as number of days, weeks, month or years after the creation date.
     The special notation &quot;seconds=N&quot; is also allowed to specify a
     number of seconds since creation.  Without a letter days are
     assumed.  Note that there is no check done on the overflow of the
     type used by OpenPGP for timestamps.  Thus you better make sure
     that the given value make sense.  Although OpenPGP works with time
     intervals, GnuPG uses an absolute value internally and thus the
     last year we can represent is 2105.

Creation-Date: ISO-DATE
     Set the creation date of the key as stored in the key information
     and which is also part of the fingerprint calculation.  Either a
     date like &quot;1986-04-26&quot; or a full timestamp like &quot;19860426T042640&quot;
     may be used.  The time is considered to be UTC. The special
     notation &quot;seconds=N&quot; may be used to directly specify a the number
     of seconds since Epoch (Unix time).  If it is not given the current
     time is used.

Preferences: STRING
     Set the cipher, hash, and compression preference values for this
     key.  This expects the same type of string as the sub-command
     ‘setpref’ in the ‘--edit-key’ menu.

Revoker: ALGO:FPR [sensitive]
     Add a designated revoker to the generated key.  Algo is the public
     key algorithm of the designated revoker (i.e.  RSA=1, DSA=17, etc.)
     FPR is the fingerprint of the designated revoker.  FPR may not
     contain spaces or colons.  The optional ‘sensitive’ flag marks the
     designated revoker as sensitive information.  Only v4 and v5 keys
     may be designated revokers.

Keyserver: STRING
     This is an optional parameter that specifies the preferred
     keyserver URL for the key.

Handle: STRING
     This is an optional parameter only used with the status lines
     KEY_CREATED and KEY_NOT_CREATED. STRING may be up to 100 characters
     and should not contain spaces.  It is useful for batch key
     generation to associate a key parameter block with a status line.

Here is an example on how to create a key in an ephemeral home
directory:
     $ export GNUPGHOME=&quot;$(mktemp -d)&quot;
     $ cat &gt;foo &lt;&lt;EOF
          %echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
          Key-Type: DSA
          Key-Length: 1024
          Subkey-Type: ELG-E
          Subkey-Length: 1024
          Name-Real: Joe Tester
          Name-Comment: with stupid passphrase
          Name-Email: joe@foo.bar
          Expire-Date: 0
          Passphrase: abc
          # Do a commit here, so that we can later print &quot;done&quot; :-)
          %commit
          %echo done
     EOF
     $ gpg --batch --generate-key foo
      [...]
     $ gpg --list-secret-keys

5.1.1 Commands not specific to the function
-------------------------------------------

‘--version’
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--help, -h’
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--warranty’
     Print warranty information.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this
     command.

‘--dump-options’
     Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Operational GPGSM Commands,  Next: Certificate Management,  Prev: General GPGSM Commands,  Up: GPGSM Commands

5.1.2 Commands to select the type of operation
----------------------------------------------

‘--encrypt’
     Perform an encryption.  The keys the data is encrypted to must be
     set using the option ‘--recipient’.

‘--decrypt’
     Perform a decryption; the type of input is automatically
     determined.  It may either be in binary form or PEM encoded;
     automatic determination of base-64 encoding is not done.

‘--sign’
     Create a digital signature.  The key used is either the fist one
     found in the keybox or those set with the ‘--local-user’ option.

‘--verify’
     Check a signature file for validity.  Depending on the arguments a
     detached signature may also be checked.

‘--server’
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the ‘stdin’.

‘--call-dirmngr COMMAND [ARGS]’
     Behave as a Dirmngr client issuing the request COMMAND with the
     optional list of ARGS.  The output of the Dirmngr is printed
     stdout.  Please note that file names given as arguments should have
     an absolute file name (i.e.  commencing with ‘/’) because they are
     passed verbatim to the Dirmngr and the working directory of the
     Dirmngr might not be the same as the one of this client.  Currently
     it is not possible to pass data via stdin to the Dirmngr.  COMMAND
     should not contain spaces.

     This is command is required for certain maintaining tasks of the
     dirmngr where a dirmngr must be able to call back to ‘gpgsm’.  See
     the Dirmngr manual for details.

‘--call-protect-tool ARGUMENTS’
     Certain maintenance operations are done by an external program call
     ‘gpg-protect-tool’; this is usually not installed in a directory
     listed in the PATH variable.  This command provides a simple
     wrapper to access this tool.  ARGUMENTS are passed verbatim to this
     command; use ‘--help’ to get a list of supported operations.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Certificate Management,  Prev: Operational GPGSM Commands,  Up: GPGSM Commands

5.1.3 How to manage the certificates and keys
---------------------------------------------

‘--generate-key’
‘--gen-key’
     This command allows the creation of a certificate signing request
     or a self-signed certificate.  It is commonly used along with the
     ‘--output’ option to save the created CSR or certificate into a
     file.  If used with the ‘--batch’ a parameter file is used to
     create the CSR or certificate and it is further possible to create
     non-self-signed certificates.

‘--list-keys’
‘-k’
     List all available certificates stored in the local key database.
     Note that the displayed data might be reformatted for better human
     readability and illegal characters are replaced by safe
     substitutes.

‘--list-secret-keys’
‘-K’
     List all available certificates for which a corresponding a secret
     key is available.

‘--list-external-keys PATTERN’
     List certificates matching PATTERN using an external server.  This
     utilizes the ‘dirmngr’ service.

‘--list-chain’
     Same as ‘--list-keys’ but also prints all keys making up the chain.

‘--dump-cert’
‘--dump-keys’
     List all available certificates stored in the local key database
     using a format useful mainly for debugging.

‘--dump-chain’
     Same as ‘--dump-keys’ but also prints all keys making up the chain.

‘--dump-secret-keys’
     List all available certificates for which a corresponding a secret
     key is available using a format useful mainly for debugging.

‘--dump-external-keys PATTERN’
     List certificates matching PATTERN using an external server.  This
     utilizes the ‘dirmngr’ service.  It uses a format useful mainly for
     debugging.

‘--show-certs [FILES]’
     This command takes certificate files as input and prints
     information about them in the same format as ‘--dump-cert’ does.
     Each file may either contain a single binary certificate or several
     PEM encoded certificates.  If no files are given, the input is
     taken from stdin.

     Please note that the listing format may be changed in future
     releases and that the option ‘--with-colons’ has currently no
     effect.

‘--keydb-clear-some-cert-flags’
     This is a debugging aid to reset certain flags in the key database
     which are used to cache certain certificate statuses.  It is
     especially useful if a bad CRL or a weird running OCSP responder
     did accidentally revoke certificate.  There is no security issue
     with this command because ‘gpgsm’ always make sure that the
     validity of a certificate is checked right before it is used.

‘--delete-keys PATTERN’
     Delete the keys matching PATTERN.  Note that there is no command to
     delete the secret part of the key directly.  In case you need to do
     this, you should run the command ‘gpgsm --dump-secret-keys KEYID’
     before you delete the key, copy the string of hex-digits in the
     &quot;keygrip&quot; line and delete the file consisting of these hex-digits
     and the suffix ‘.key’ from the ‘private-keys-v1.d’ directory below
     our GnuPG home directory (usually ‘~/.gnupg’).

‘--export [PATTERN]’
     Export all certificates stored in the Keybox or those specified by
     the optional PATTERN.  Those pattern consist of a list of user ids
     (*note how-to-specify-a-user-id::).  When used along with the
     ‘--armor’ option a few informational lines are prepended before
     each block.  There is one limitation: As there is no commonly
     agreed upon way to pack more than one certificate into an ASN.1
     structure, the binary export (i.e.  without using ‘armor’) works
     only for the export of one certificate.  Thus it is required to
     specify a PATTERN which yields exactly one certificate.  Ephemeral
     certificate are only exported if all PATTERN are given as
     fingerprints or keygrips.

‘--export-secret-key-p12 KEY-ID’
     Export the private key and the certificate identified by KEY-ID
     using the PKCS#12 format.  When used with the ‘--armor’ option a
     few informational lines are prepended to the output.  Note, that
     the PKCS#12 format is not very secure and proper transport security
     should be used to convey the exported key.  (*Note option
     --p12-charset::.)

‘--export-secret-key-p8 KEY-ID’
‘--export-secret-key-raw KEY-ID’
     Export the private key of the certificate identified by KEY-ID with
     any encryption stripped.  The ‘...-raw’ command exports in PKCS#1
     format; the ‘...-p8’ command exports in PKCS#8 format.  When used
     with the ‘--armor’ option a few informational lines are prepended
     to the output.  These commands are useful to prepare a key for use
     on a TLS server.

‘--import [FILES]’
     Import the certificates from the PEM or binary encoded files as
     well as from signed-only messages.  This command may also be used
     to import a secret key from a PKCS#12 file.

‘--learn-card’
     Read information about the private keys from the smartcard and
     import the certificates from there.  This command utilizes the
     ‘gpg-agent’ and in turn the ‘scdaemon’.

‘--change-passphrase USER_ID’
‘--passwd USER_ID’
     Change the passphrase of the private key belonging to the
     certificate specified as USER_ID.  Note, that changing the
     passphrase/PIN of a smartcard is not yet supported.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Configuration Options,  Next: Certificate Options,  Up: GPGSM Options

5.2.1 How to change the configuration
-------------------------------------

These options are used to change the configuration and are usually found
in the option file.

‘--options FILE’
     Reads configuration from FILE instead of from the default per-user
     configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
     ‘gpgsm.conf’ and expected in the ‘.gnupg’ directory directly below
     the home directory of the user.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to ‘gpgsm’, such as
     ‘-vv’.

‘--keyserver STRING’
     This is a deprecated option.  It was used to add an LDAP server to
     use for X.509 certificate and CRL lookup.  The alias ‘--ldapserver’
     existed from version 2.2.28 to 2.2.33 and 2.3.2 to 2.3.4 but is now
     entirely ignored.

     LDAP servers must be given in the configuration for ‘dirmngr’.

‘--policy-file FILENAME’
     Change the default name of the policy file to FILENAME.  The
     default name is ‘policies.txt’.

‘--agent-program FILE’
     Specify an agent program to be used for secret key operations.  The
     default value is determined by running the command ‘gpgconf’.  Note
     that the pipe symbol (‘|’) is used for a regression test suite hack
     and may thus not be used in the file name.

‘--dirmngr-program FILE’
     Specify a dirmngr program to be used for CRL checks.  The default
     value is ‘/usr/bin/dirmngr’.

‘--prefer-system-dirmngr’
     This option is obsolete and ignored.

‘--disable-dirmngr’
     Entirely disable the use of the Dirmngr.

‘--no-autostart’
     Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not yet been
     started and its service is required.  This option is mostly useful
     on machines where the connection to gpg-agent has been redirected
     to another machines.  If dirmngr is required on the remote machine,
     it may be started manually using ‘gpgconf --launch dirmngr’.

‘--no-secmem-warning’
     Do not print a warning when the so called &quot;secure memory&quot; cannot be
     used.

‘--log-file FILE’
     When running in server mode, append all logging output to FILE.
     Use ‘socket://’ to log to socket.

‘--log-time’
     Prefix all log output with a timestamp even if no log file is used.

5.2.2 Certificate related options
---------------------------------

‘--enable-policy-checks’
‘--disable-policy-checks’
     By default policy checks are enabled.  These options may be used to
     change it.

‘--enable-crl-checks’
‘--disable-crl-checks’
     By default the CRL checks are enabled and the DirMngr is used to
     check for revoked certificates.  The disable option is most useful
     with an off-line network connection to suppress this check and also
     to avoid that new certificates introduce a web bug by including a
     certificate specific CRL DP. The disable option also disables an
     issuer certificate lookup via the authorityInfoAccess property of
     the certificate; the ‘--enable-issuer-key-retrieve’ can be used to
     make use of that property anyway.

‘--enable-trusted-cert-crl-check’
‘--disable-trusted-cert-crl-check’
     By default the CRL for trusted root certificates are checked like
     for any other certificates.  This allows a CA to revoke its own
     certificates voluntary without the need of putting all ever issued
     certificates into a CRL. The disable option may be used to switch
     this extra check off.  Due to the caching done by the Dirmngr,
     there will not be any noticeable performance gain.  Note, that this
     also disables possible OCSP checks for trusted root certificates.
     A more specific way of disabling this check is by adding the
     &quot;relax&quot; keyword to the root CA line of the ‘trustlist.txt’

‘--force-crl-refresh’
     Tell the dirmngr to reload the CRL for each request.  For better
     performance, the dirmngr will actually optimize this by suppressing
     the loading for short time intervals (e.g.  30 minutes).  This
     option is useful to make sure that a fresh CRL is available for
     certificates hold in the keybox.  The suggested way of doing this
     is by using it along with the option ‘--with-validation’ for a key
     listing command.  This option should not be used in a configuration
     file.

‘--enable-issuer-based-crl-check’
     Run a CRL check even for certificates which do not have any CRL
     distribution point.  This requires that a suitable LDAP server has
     been configured in Dirmngr and that the CRL can be found using the
     issuer.  This option reverts to what GnuPG did up to version
     2.2.20.  This option is in general not useful.

‘--enable-ocsp’
‘--disable-ocsp’
     By default OCSP checks are disabled.  The enable option may be used
     to enable OCSP checks via Dirmngr.  If CRL checks are also enabled,
     CRLs will be used as a fallback if for some reason an OCSP request
     will not succeed.  Note, that you have to allow OCSP requests in
     Dirmngr&#39;s configuration too (option ‘--allow-ocsp’) and configure
     Dirmngr properly.  If you do not do so you will get the error code
     ‘Not supported’.

‘--auto-issuer-key-retrieve’
     If a required certificate is missing while validating the chain of
     certificates, try to load that certificate from an external
     location.  This usually means that Dirmngr is employed to search
     for the certificate.  Note that this option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like
     behavior possible.  LDAP server operators can see which keys you
     request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand new key
     (which you naturally will not have on your local keybox), the
     operator can tell both your IP address and the time when you
     verified the signature.  Note that if CRL checking is not disabled
     issuer certificates are retrieved in any case using the caIssuers
     authorityInfoAccess method.

‘--validation-model NAME’
     This option changes the default validation model.  The only
     possible values are &quot;shell&quot; (which is the default), &quot;chain&quot; which
     forces the use of the chain model and &quot;steed&quot; for a new simplified
     model.  The chain model is also used if an option in the
     ‘trustlist.txt’ or an attribute of the certificate requests it.
     However the standard model (shell) is in that case always tried
     first.

‘--ignore-cert-extension OID’
     Add OID to the list of ignored certificate extensions.  The OID is
     expected to be in dotted decimal form, like ‘2.5.29.3’.  This
     option may be used more than once.  Critical flagged certificate
     extensions matching one of the OIDs in the list are treated as if
     they are actually handled and thus the certificate will not be
     rejected due to an unknown critical extension.  Use this option
     with care because extensions are usually flagged as critical for a
     reason.

5.2.3 Input and Output
----------------------

‘--armor’
‘-a’
     Create PEM encoded output.  Default is binary output.

‘--base64’
     Create Base-64 encoded output; i.e.  PEM without the header lines.

‘--assume-armor’
     Assume the input data is PEM encoded.  Default is to autodetect the
     encoding but this is may fail.

‘--assume-base64’
     Assume the input data is plain base-64 encoded.

‘--assume-binary’
     Assume the input data is binary encoded.

‘--input-size-hint N’
     This option can be used to tell GPGSM the size of the input data in
     bytes.  N must be a positive base-10 number.  It is used by the
     ‘--status-fd’ line &quot;PROGRESS&quot; to provide a value for &quot;total&quot; if
     that is not available by other means.

‘--p12-charset NAME’
     ‘gpgsm’ uses the UTF-8 encoding when encoding passphrases for
     PKCS#12 files.  This option may be used to force the passphrase to
     be encoded in the specified encoding NAME.  This is useful if the
     application used to import the key uses a different encoding and
     thus will not be able to import a file generated by ‘gpgsm’.
     Commonly used values for NAME are ‘Latin1’ and ‘CP850’.  Note that
     ‘gpgsm’ itself automagically imports any file with a passphrase
     encoded to the most commonly used encodings.

‘--default-key USER_ID’
     Use USER_ID as the standard key for signing.  This key is used if
     no other key has been defined as a signing key.  Note, that the
     first ‘--local-users’ option also sets this key if it has not yet
     been set; however ‘--default-key’ always overrides this.

‘--local-user USER_ID’
‘-u USER_ID’
     Set the user(s) to be used for signing.  The default is the first
     secret key found in the database.

‘--recipient NAME’
‘-r’
     Encrypt to the user id NAME.  There are several ways a user id may
     be given (*note how-to-specify-a-user-id::).

‘--output FILE’
‘-o FILE’
     Write output to FILE.  The default is to write it to stdout.

‘--with-key-data’
     Displays extra information with the ‘--list-keys’ commands.
     Especially a line tagged ‘grp’ is printed which tells you the
     keygrip of a key.  This string is for example used as the file name
     of the secret key.  Implies ‘--with-colons’.

‘--with-validation’
     When doing a key listing, do a full validation check for each key
     and print the result.  This is usually a slow operation because it
     requires a CRL lookup and other operations.

     When used along with ‘--import’, a validation of the certificate to
     import is done and only imported if it succeeds the test.  Note
     that this does not affect an already available certificate in the
     DB. This option is therefore useful to simply verify a certificate.

‘--with-md5-fingerprint’
     For standard key listings, also print the MD5 fingerprint of the
     certificate.

‘--with-keygrip’
     Include the keygrip in standard key listings.  Note that the
     keygrip is always listed in ‘--with-colons’ mode.

‘--with-secret’
     Include info about the presence of a secret key in public key
     listings done with ‘--with-colons’.

‘--no-pretty-dn’
     By default gpgsm prints distinguished names (DNs) like the Issuer
     or Subject in a more readable format (e.g.  using a well defined
     order of the parts).  However, this format can&#39;t be used as input
     strings.  This option reverts printing to standard RFC-2253 format
     and thus avoids the need to use -dump-cert or -with-colons to get
     the &quot;real&quot; name.

5.2.4 How to change how the CMS is created
------------------------------------------

‘--include-certs N’
     Using N of -2 includes all certificate except for the root cert, -1
     includes all certs, 0 does not include any certs, 1 includes only
     the signers cert and all other positive values include up to N
     certificates starting with the signer cert.  The default is -2.

‘--cipher-algo OID’
     Use the cipher algorithm with the ASN.1 object identifier OID for
     encryption.  For convenience the strings ‘3DES’, ‘AES’ and ‘AES256’
     may be used instead of their OIDs.  The default is ‘AES’
     (2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2).

‘--digest-algo name’
     Use ‘name’ as the message digest algorithm.  Usually this algorithm
     is deduced from the respective signing certificate.  This option
     forces the use of the given algorithm and may lead to severe
     interoperability problems.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Esoteric Options,  Prev: CMS Options,  Up: GPGSM Options

5.2.5 Doing things one usually do not want to do
------------------------------------------------

‘--chuid UID’
     Change the current user to UID which may either be a number or a
     name.  This can be used from the root account to run gpgsm for
     another user.  If UID is not the current UID a standard PATH is set
     and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the
     option ‘--homedir’ can be used.  This option has only an effect
     when used on the command line.  This option has currently no effect
     at all on Windows.

‘--extra-digest-algo NAME’
     Sometimes signatures are broken in that they announce a different
     digest algorithm than actually used.  ‘gpgsm’ uses a one-pass data
     processing model and thus needs to rely on the announced digest
     algorithms to properly hash the data.  As a workaround this option
     may be used to tell ‘gpgsm’ to also hash the data using the
     algorithm NAME; this slows processing down a little bit but allows
     verification of such broken signatures.  If ‘gpgsm’ prints an error
     like &quot;digest algo 8 has not been enabled&quot; you may want to try this
     option, with ‘SHA256’ for NAME.

‘--compliance STRING’
     Set the compliance mode.  Valid values are shown when using &quot;help&quot;
     for STRING.

‘--min-rsa-length N’
     This option adjusts the compliance mode &quot;de-vs&quot; for stricter key
     size requirements.  For example, a value of 3000 turns rsa2048 and
     dsa2048 keys into non-VS-NfD compliant keys.

‘--require-compliance’
     To check that data has been encrypted according to the rules of the
     current compliance mode, a gpgsm user needs to evaluate the status
     lines.  This is allows frontends to handle compliance check in a
     more flexible way.  However, for scripted use the required
     evaluation of the status-line requires quite some effort; this
     option can be used instead to make sure that the gpgsm process
     exits with a failure if the compliance rules are not fulfilled.
     Note that this option has currently an effect only in &quot;de-vs&quot; mode.

‘--always-trust’
     Force encryption to the specified certificates without any
     validation of the certificate chain.  The only requirement is that
     the certificate is capable of encryption.  Note that this option is
     ineffective if ‘--require-compliance’ is used.

‘--ignore-cert-with-oid OID’
     Add OID to the list of OIDs to be checked while reading
     certificates from smartcards.  The OID is expected to be in dotted
     decimal form, like ‘2.5.29.3’.  This option may be used more than
     once.  As of now certificates with an extended key usage matching
     one of those OIDs are ignored during a ‘--learn-card’ operation and
     not imported.  This option can help to keep the local key database
     clear of unneeded certificates stored on smartcards.

‘--faked-system-time EPOCH’
     This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time
     back or forth to EPOCH which is the number of seconds elapsed since
     the year 1970.  Alternatively EPOCH may be given as a full ISO time
     string (e.g.  &quot;20070924T154812&quot;).

‘--with-ephemeral-keys’
     Include ephemeral flagged keys in the output of key listings.  Note
     that they are included anyway if the key specification for a
     listing is given as fingerprint or keygrip.

‘--compatibility-flags FLAGS’
     Set compatibility flags to work around problems due to
     non-compliant certificates or data.  The FLAGS are given as a comma
     separated list of flag names and are OR-ed together.  The special
     flag &quot;none&quot; clears the list and allows one to start over with an
     empty list.  To get a list of available flags the sole word &quot;help&quot;
     can be used.

‘--debug-level LEVEL’
     Select the debug level for investigating problems.  LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or by a keyword:

     ‘none’
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of the keyword.
     ‘basic’
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘advanced’
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘expert’
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘guru’
          All of the debug messages you can get.  A value greater than 8
          may be used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program.  They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

‘--debug FLAGS’
     Set debug flags.  All flags are or-ed and FLAGS may be given in C
     syntax (e.g.  0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.
     To get a list of all supported flags the single word &quot;help&quot; can be
     used.  This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior
     may change at any time without notice.

     Note, that all flags set using this option may get overridden by
     ‘--debug-level’.

‘--debug-all’
     Same as ‘--debug=0xffffffff’

‘--debug-allow-core-dump’
     Usually ‘gpgsm’ tries to avoid dumping core by well written code
     and by disabling core dumps for security reasons.  However, bugs
     are pretty durable beasts and to squash them it is sometimes useful
     to have a core dump.  This option enables core dumps unless the Bad
     Thing happened before the option parsing.

‘--debug-no-chain-validation’
     This is actually not a debugging option but only useful as such.
     It lets ‘gpgsm’ bypass all certificate chain validation checks.

‘--debug-ignore-expiration’
     This is actually not a debugging option but only useful as such.
     It lets ‘gpgsm’ ignore all notAfter dates, this is used by the
     regression tests.

‘--passphrase-fd n’
     Read the passphrase from file descriptor ‘n’.  Only the first line
     will be read from file descriptor ‘n’.  If you use 0 for ‘n’, the
     passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if only
     one passphrase is supplied.

     Note that this passphrase is only used if the option ‘--batch’ has
     also been given.

‘--pinentry-mode mode’
     Set the pinentry mode to ‘mode’.  Allowed values for ‘mode’ are:
     default
          Use the default of the agent, which is ‘ask’.
     ask
          Force the use of the Pinentry.
     cancel
          Emulate use of Pinentry&#39;s cancel button.
     error
          Return a Pinentry error (&quot;No Pinentry&quot;).
     loopback
          Redirect Pinentry queries to the caller.  Note that in
          contrast to Pinentry the user is not prompted again if he
          enters a bad password.

‘--request-origin ORIGIN’
     Tell gpgsm to assume that the operation ultimately originated at
     ORIGIN.  Depending on the origin certain restrictions are applied
     and the Pinentry may include an extra note on the origin.
     Supported values for ORIGIN are: ‘local’ which is the default,
     ‘remote’ to indicate a remote origin or ‘browser’ for an operation
     requested by a web browser.

‘--no-common-certs-import’
     Suppress the import of common certificates on keybox creation.

   All the long options may also be given in the configuration file
after stripping off the two leading dashes.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM Configuration,  Next: GPGSM Examples,  Prev: GPGSM Options,  Up: Invoking GPGSM

5.3 Configuration files
=======================

There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of
‘gpgsm’&#39;s operation.  Unless noted, they are expected in the current
home directory (*note option --homedir::).

‘gpgsm.conf’
     This is the standard configuration file read by ‘gpgsm’ on startup.
     It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes may
     not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This default
     name may be changed on the command line (*note gpgsm-option
     --options::).  You should backup this file.

‘common.conf’
     This is an optional configuration file read by ‘gpgsm’ on startup.
     It may contain options pertaining to all components of GnuPG. Its
     current main use is for the &quot;use-keyboxd&quot; option.

‘policies.txt’
     This is a list of allowed CA policies.  This file should list the
     object identifiers of the policies line by line.  Empty lines and
     lines starting with a hash mark are ignored.  Policies missing in
     this file and not marked as critical in the certificate will print
     only a warning; certificates with policies marked as critical and
     not listed in this file will fail the signature verification.  You
     should backup this file.

     For example, to allow only the policy 2.289.9.9, the file should
     look like this:

          # Allowed policies
          2.289.9.9

‘qualified.txt’
     This is the list of root certificates used for qualified
     certificates.  They are defined as certificates capable of creating
     legally binding signatures in the same way as handwritten
     signatures are.  Comments start with a hash mark and empty lines
     are ignored.  Lines do have a length limit but this is not a
     serious limitation as the format of the entries is fixed and
     checked by ‘gpgsm’: A non-comment line starts with optional
     whitespace, followed by exactly 40 hex characters, white space and
     a lowercased 2 letter country code.  Additional data delimited with
     by a white space is current ignored but might late be used for
     other purposes.

     Note that even if a certificate is listed in this file, this does
     not mean that the certificate is trusted; in general the
     certificates listed in this file need to be listed also in
     ‘trustlist.txt’.  This is a global file an installed in the sysconf
     directory (e.g.  ‘/etc/gnupg/qualified.txt’).

     Every time ‘gpgsm’ uses a certificate for signing or verification
     this file will be consulted to check whether the certificate under
     question has ultimately been issued by one of these CAs.  If this
     is the case the user will be informed that the verified signature
     represents a legally binding (&quot;qualified&quot;) signature.  When
     creating a signature using such a certificate an extra prompt will
     be issued to let the user confirm that such a legally binding
     signature shall really be created.

     Because this software has not yet been approved for use with such
     certificates, appropriate notices will be shown to indicate this
     fact.

‘help.txt’
     This is plain text file with a few help entries used with
     ‘pinentry’ as well as a large list of help items for ‘gpg’ and
     ‘gpgsm’.  The standard file has English help texts; to install
     localized versions use filenames like ‘help.LL.txt’ with LL
     denoting the locale.  GnuPG comes with a set of predefined help
     files in the data directory (e.g.
     ‘/usr/share/gnupg/gnupg/help.de.txt’) and allows overriding of any
     help item by help files stored in the system configuration
     directory (e.g.  ‘/etc/gnupg/help.de.txt’).  For a reference of the
     help file&#39;s syntax, please see the installed ‘help.txt’ file.

‘com-certs.pem’
     This file is a collection of common certificates used to populated
     a newly created ‘pubring.kbx’.  An administrator may replace this
     file with a custom one.  The format is a concatenation of PEM
     encoded X.509 certificates.  This global file is installed in the
     data directory (e.g.  ‘/usr/share/gnupg/com-certs.pem’).

   Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined
files into the directory ‘/etc/skel/.gnupg/’ so that newly created users
start up with a working configuration.  For existing users a small
helper script is provided to create these files (*note addgnupghome::).

   For internal purposes ‘gpgsm’ creates and maintains a few other
files; they all live in the current home directory (*note option
--homedir::).  Only ‘gpgsm’ may modify these files.

‘pubring.kbx’
     This a database file storing the certificates as well as meta
     information.  For debugging purposes the tool ‘kbxutil’ may be used
     to show the internal structure of this file.  You should backup
     this file.

‘random_seed’
     This content of this file is used to maintain the internal state of
     the random number generator across invocations.  The same file is
     used by other programs of this software too.

‘S.gpg-agent’
     If this file exists ‘gpgsm’ will first try to connect to this
     socket for accessing ‘gpg-agent’ before starting a new ‘gpg-agent’
     instance.  Under Windows this socket (which in reality be a plain
     file describing a regular TCP listening port) is the standard way
     of connecting the ‘gpg-agent’.

5.5 Unattended Usage
====================

‘gpgsm’ is often used as a backend engine by other software.  To help
with this a machine interface has been defined to have an unambiguous
way to do this.  This is most likely used with the ‘--server’ command
but may also be used in the standard operation mode by using the
‘--status-fd’ option.

5.5.1 Automated signature checking
----------------------------------

It is very important to understand the semantics used with signature
verification.  Checking a signature is not as simple as it may sound and
so the operation is a bit complicated.  In most cases it is required to
look at several status lines.  Here is a table of all cases a signed
message may have:

The signature is valid
     This does mean that the signature has been successfully verified,
     the certificates are all sane.  However there are two subcases with
     important information: One of the certificates may have expired or
     a signature of a message itself as expired.  It is a sound practise
     to consider such a signature still as valid but additional
     information should be displayed.  Depending on the subcase ‘gpgsm’
     will issue these status codes:
     signature valid and nothing did expire
          ‘GOODSIG’, ‘VALIDSIG’, ‘TRUST_FULLY’
     signature valid but at least one certificate has expired
          ‘EXPKEYSIG’, ‘VALIDSIG’, ‘TRUST_FULLY’
     signature valid but expired
          ‘EXPSIG’, ‘VALIDSIG’, ‘TRUST_FULLY’ Note, that this case is
          currently not implemented.

The signature is invalid
     This means that the signature verification failed (this is an
     indication of a transfer error, a program error or tampering with
     the message).  ‘gpgsm’ issues one of these status codes sequences:
     ‘BADSIG’
     ‘GOODSIG, VALIDSIG TRUST_NEVER’

Error verifying a signature
     For some reason the signature could not be verified, i.e.  it
     cannot be decided whether the signature is valid or invalid.  A
     common reason for this is a missing certificate.

5.5.2 CSR and certificate creation
----------------------------------

The command ‘--generate-key’ may be used along with the option ‘--batch’
to either create a certificate signing request (CSR) or an X.509
certificate.  This is controlled by a parameter file; the format of this
file is as follows:

   • Text only, line length is limited to about 1000 characters.
   • UTF-8 encoding must be used to specify non-ASCII characters.
   • Empty lines are ignored.
   • Leading and trailing while space is ignored.
   • A hash sign as the first non white space character indicates a
     comment line.
   • Control statements are indicated by a leading percent sign, the
     arguments are separated by white space from the keyword.
   • Parameters are specified by a keyword, followed by a colon.
     Arguments are separated by white space.
   • The first parameter must be ‘Key-Type’, control statements may be
     placed anywhere.
   • The order of the parameters does not matter except for ‘Key-Type’
     which must be the first parameter.  The parameters are only used
     for the generated CSR/certificate; parameters from previous sets
     are not used.  Some syntactically checks may be performed.
   • Key generation takes place when either the end of the parameter
     file is reached, the next ‘Key-Type’ parameter is encountered or at
     the control statement ‘%commit’ is encountered.

Control statements:

%echo TEXT
     Print TEXT as diagnostic.

%dry-run
     Suppress actual key generation (useful for syntax checking).

%commit
     Perform the key generation.  Note that an implicit commit is done
     at the next Key-Type parameter.

General Parameters:

Key-Type: ALGO
     Starts a new parameter block by giving the type of the primary key.
     The algorithm must be capable of signing.  This is a required
     parameter.  The supported values for ALGO are ‘rsa’, ‘ecdsa’, and
     ‘eddsa’.

Key-Length: NBITS
     The requested length of a generated key in bits.  Defaults to 3072.
     The value is ignored for ECC algorithms.

Key-Grip: HEXSTRING
     This is optional and used to generate a CSR or certificate for an
     already existing key.  Key-Length will be ignored when given.

Key-Usage: USAGE-LIST
     Space or comma delimited list of key usage, allowed values are
     ‘encrypt’, ‘sign’ and ‘cert’.  This is used to generate the
     keyUsage extension.  Please make sure that the algorithm is capable
     of this usage.  Default is to allow encrypt and sign.

Name-DN: SUBJECT-NAME
     This is the Distinguished Name (DN) of the subject in RFC-2253
     format.

Name-Email: STRING
     This is an email address for the altSubjectName.  This parameter is
     optional but may occur several times to add several email addresses
     to a certificate.

Name-DNS: STRING
     The is an DNS name for the altSubjectName.  This parameter is
     optional but may occur several times to add several DNS names to a
     certificate.

Name-URI: STRING
     This is an URI for the altSubjectName.  This parameter is optional
     but may occur several times to add several URIs to a certificate.

Additional parameters used to create a certificate (in contrast to a
certificate signing request):

Serial: SN
     If this parameter is given an X.509 certificate will be generated.
     SN is expected to be a hex string representing an unsigned integer
     of arbitrary length.  The special value ‘random’ can be used to
     create a 64 bit random serial number.

Issuer-DN: ISSUER-NAME
     This is the DN name of the issuer in RFC-2253 format.  If it is not
     set it will default to the subject DN and a special GnuPG extension
     will be included in the certificate to mark it as a standalone
     certificate.

Creation-Date: ISO-DATE
Not-Before: ISO-DATE
     Set the notBefore date of the certificate.  Either a date like
     ‘1986-04-26’ or ‘1986-04-26 12:00’ or a standard ISO timestamp like
     ‘19860426T042640’ may be used.  The time is considered to be UTC.
     If it is not given the current date is used.

Expire-Date: ISO-DATE
Not-After: ISO-DATE
     Set the notAfter date of the certificate.  Either a date like
     ‘2063-04-05’ or ‘2063-04-05 17:00’ or a standard ISO timestamp like
     ‘20630405T170000’ may be used.  The time is considered to be UTC.
     If it is not given a default value in the not too far future is
     used.

Signing-Key: KEYGRIP
     This gives the keygrip of the key used to sign the certificate.  If
     it is not given a self-signed certificate will be created.  For
     compatibility with future versions, it is suggested to prefix the
     keygrip with a ‘&amp;’.

Hash-Algo: HASH-ALGO
     Use HASH-ALGO for this CSR or certificate.  The supported hash
     algorithms are: ‘sha1’, ‘sha256’, ‘sha384’ and ‘sha512’; they may
     also be specified with uppercase letters.  The default is ‘sha256’.

Authority-Key-Id: HEXSTRING
     Insert the decoded value of HEXSTRING as authorityKeyIdentifier.
     If this is not given and an ECC algorithm is used the public part
     of the certified public key is used as authorityKeyIdentifier.  To
     inhibit any authorityKeyIdentifier use the special value ‘none’ for
     HEXSTRING.

Subject-Key-Id: HEXSTRING
     Insert the decoded value of HEXSTRING as subjectKeyIdentifier.  If
     this is not given and an ECC algorithm is used the public part of
     the signing key is used as authorityKeyIdentifier.  To inhibit any
     subjectKeyIdentifier use the special value ‘none’ for HEXSTRING.

5.6 The Protocol the Server Mode Uses
=====================================

Description of the protocol used to access ‘GPGSM’.  ‘GPGSM’ does
implement the Assuan protocol and in addition provides a regular command
line interface which exhibits a full client to this protocol (but uses
internal linking).  To start ‘gpgsm’ as a server the command line the
option ‘--server’ must be used.  Additional options are provided to
select the communication method (i.e.  the name of the socket).

   We assume that the connection has already been established; see the
Assuan manual for details.

5.6.1 Encrypting a Message
--------------------------

Before encryption can be done the recipient must be set using the
command:

       RECIPIENT USERID

   Set the recipient for the encryption.  USERID should be the internal
representation of the key; the server may accept any other way of
specification.  If this is a valid and trusted recipient the server does
respond with OK, otherwise the return is an ERR with the reason why the
recipient cannot be used, the encryption will then not be done for this
recipient.  If the policy is not to encrypt at all if not all recipients
are valid, the client has to take care of this.  All ‘RECIPIENT’
commands are cumulative until a ‘RESET’ or an successful ‘ENCRYPT’
command.

       INPUT FD[=N] [--armor|--base64|--binary]

   Set the file descriptor for the message to be encrypted to N.
Obviously the pipe must be open at that point, the server establishes
its own end.  If the server returns an error the client should consider
this session failed.  If N is not given, this commands uses the last
file descriptor passed to the application.  *Note the assuan_sendfd
function: (assuan)fun-assuan_sendfd, on how to do descriptor passing.

   The ‘--armor’ option may be used to advise the server that the input
data is in PEM format, ‘--base64’ advises that a raw base-64 encoding is
used, ‘--binary’ advises of raw binary input (BER).  If none of these
options is used, the server tries to figure out the used encoding, but
this may not always be correct.

       OUTPUT FD[=N] [--armor|--base64]

   Set the file descriptor to be used for the output (i.e.  the
encrypted message).  Obviously the pipe must be open at that point, the
server establishes its own end.  If the server returns an error the
client should consider this session failed.

   The option ‘--armor’ encodes the output in PEM format, the ‘--base64’
option applies just a base-64 encoding.  No option creates binary output
(BER).

   The actual encryption is done using the command

       ENCRYPT

   It takes the plaintext from the ‘INPUT’ command, writes to the
ciphertext to the file descriptor set with the ‘OUTPUT’ command, take
the recipients from all the recipients set so far.  If this command
fails the clients should try to delete all output currently done or
otherwise mark it as invalid.  ‘GPGSM’ does ensure that there will not
be any security problem with leftover data on the output in this case.

   This command should in general not fail, as all necessary checks have
been done while setting the recipients.  The input and output pipes are
closed.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM DECRYPT,  Next: GPGSM SIGN,  Prev: GPGSM ENCRYPT,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.2 Decrypting a message
--------------------------

Input and output FDs are set the same way as in encryption, but ‘INPUT’
refers to the ciphertext and ‘OUTPUT’ to the plaintext.  There is no
need to set recipients.  ‘GPGSM’ automatically strips any S/MIME headers
from the input, so it is valid to pass an entire MIME part to the INPUT
pipe.

   The decryption is done by using the command

       DECRYPT

   It performs the decrypt operation after doing some check on the
internal state (e.g.  that all needed data has been set).  Because it
utilizes the GPG-Agent for the session key decryption, there is no need
to ask the client for a protecting passphrase - GpgAgent takes care of
this by requesting this from the user.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM SIGN,  Next: GPGSM VERIFY,  Prev: GPGSM DECRYPT,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.3 Signing a Message
-----------------------

Signing is usually done with these commands:

       INPUT FD[=N] [--armor|--base64|--binary]

   This tells ‘GPGSM’ to read the data to sign from file descriptor N.

       OUTPUT FD[=M] [--armor|--base64]

   Write the output to file descriptor M.  If a detached signature is
requested, only the signature is written.

       SIGN [--detached]

   Sign the data set with the ‘INPUT’ command and write it to the sink
set by ‘OUTPUT’.  With ‘--detached’, a detached signature is created
(surprise).

   The key used for signing is the default one or the one specified in
the configuration file.  To get finer control over the keys, it is
possible to use the command

       SIGNER USERID

   to set the signer&#39;s key.  USERID should be the internal
representation of the key; the server may accept any other way of
specification.  If this is a valid and trusted recipient the server does
respond with OK, otherwise the return is an ERR with the reason why the
key cannot be used, the signature will then not be created using this
key.  If the policy is not to sign at all if not all keys are valid, the
client has to take care of this.  All ‘SIGNER’ commands are cumulative
until a ‘RESET’ is done.  Note that a ‘SIGN’ does not reset this list of
signers which is in contrast to the ‘RECIPIENT’ command.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM VERIFY,  Next: GPGSM GENKEY,  Prev: GPGSM SIGN,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.4 Verifying a Message
-------------------------

To verify a message the command:

       VERIFY

   is used.  It does a verify operation on the message send to the input
FD. The result is written out using status lines.  If an output FD was
given, the signed text will be written to that.  If the signature is a
detached one, the server will inquire about the signed material and the
client must provide it.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM GENKEY,  Next: GPGSM LISTKEYS,  Prev: GPGSM VERIFY,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.5 Generating a Key
----------------------

This is used to generate a new keypair, store the secret part in the PSE
and the public key in the key database.  We will probably add optional
commands to allow the client to select whether a hardware token is used
to store the key.  Configuration options to ‘GPGSM’ can be used to
restrict the use of this command.

       GENKEY

   ‘GPGSM’ checks whether this command is allowed and then does an
INQUIRY to get the key parameters, the client should then send the key
parameters in the native format:

         S: INQUIRE KEY_PARAM native
         C: D foo:fgfgfg
         C: D bar
         C: END

   Please note that the server may send Status info lines while reading
the data lines from the client.  After this the key generation takes
place and the server eventually does send an ERR or OK response.  Status
lines may be issued as a progress indicator.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM LISTKEYS,  Next: GPGSM EXPORT,  Prev: GPGSM GENKEY,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.6 List available keys
-------------------------

To list the keys in the internal database or using an external key
provider, the command:

       LISTKEYS  PATTERN

   is used.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed during the
search) quoting is required: Spaces are to be translated into &quot;+&quot; or
into &quot;%20&quot;; in turn this requires that the usual escape quoting rules
are done.

       LISTSECRETKEYS PATTERN

   Lists only the keys where a secret key is available.

   The list commands are affected by the option

       OPTION list-mode=MODE

   where mode may be:
‘0’
     Use default (which is usually the same as 1).
‘1’
     List only the internal keys.
‘2’
     List only the external keys.
‘3’
     List internal and external keys.

   Note that options are valid for the entire session.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM EXPORT,  Next: GPGSM IMPORT,  Prev: GPGSM LISTKEYS,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.7 Export certificates
-------------------------

To export certificate from the internal key database the command:

       EXPORT [--data [--armor] [--base64]] [--] PATTERN

   is used.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed) quoting is
required: Spaces are to be translated into &quot;+&quot; or into &quot;%20&quot;; in turn
this requires that the usual escape quoting rules are done.

   If the ‘--data’ option has not been given, the format of the output
depends on what was set with the ‘OUTPUT’ command.  When using PEM
encoding a few informational lines are prepended.

   If the ‘--data’ has been given, a target set via ‘OUTPUT’ is ignored
and the data is returned inline using standard ‘D’-lines.  This avoids
the need for an extra file descriptor.  In this case the options
‘--armor’ and ‘--base64’ may be used in the same way as with the
‘OUTPUT’ command.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM IMPORT,  Next: GPGSM DELETE,  Prev: GPGSM EXPORT,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.8 Import certificates
-------------------------

To import certificates into the internal key database, the command

       IMPORT [--re-import]

   is used.  The data is expected on the file descriptor set with the
‘INPUT’ command.  Certain checks are performed on the certificate.  Note
that the code will also handle PKCS#12 files and import private keys; a
helper program is used for that.

   With the option ‘--re-import’ the input data is expected to a be a
linefeed separated list of fingerprints.  The command will re-import the
corresponding certificates; that is they are made permanent by removing
their ephemeral flag.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM DELETE,  Next: GPGSM GETAUDITLOG,  Prev: GPGSM IMPORT,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.9 Delete certificates
-------------------------

To delete a certificate the command

       DELKEYS PATTERN

   is used.  To allow multiple patterns (which are ORed) quoting is
required: Spaces are to be translated into &quot;+&quot; or into &quot;%20&quot;; in turn
this requires that the usual escape quoting rules are done.

   The certificates must be specified unambiguously otherwise an error
is returned.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM GETAUDITLOG,  Next: GPGSM GETINFO,  Prev: GPGSM DELETE,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.10 Retrieve an audit log
----------------------------

This command is used to retrieve an audit log.

     GETAUDITLOG [--data] [--html]

   If ‘--data’ is used, the audit log is send using D-lines instead of
being sent to the file descriptor given by an ‘OUTPUT’ command.  If
‘--html’ is used, the output is formatted as an XHTML block.  This is
designed to be incorporated into a HTML document.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM GETINFO,  Next: GPGSM OPTION,  Prev: GPGSM GETAUDITLOG,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.11 Return information about the process
-------------------------------------------

This is a multipurpose function to return a variety of information.

     GETINFO WHAT

   The value of WHAT specifies the kind of information returned:
‘version’
     Return the version of the program.
‘pid’
     Return the process id of the process.
‘agent-check’
     Return OK if the agent is running.
‘cmd_has_option CMD OPT’
     Return OK if the command CMD implements the option OPT.  The
     leading two dashes usually used with OPT shall not be given.
‘offline’
     Return OK if the connection is in offline mode.  This may be either
     due to a ‘OPTION offline=1’ or due to ‘gpgsm’ being started with
     option ‘--disable-dirmngr’.
‘always-trust’
     Returns OK of the connection is in always-trust mode.  That is
     either ‘--always-trust’ or ‘GPGSM OPTION always-trust’ are active.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: GPGSM OPTION,  Prev: GPGSM GETINFO,  Up: GPGSM Protocol

5.6.12 Session options
----------------------

The standard Assuan option handler supports these options.

     OPTION NAME[=VALUE]

   These NAMEs are recognized:

‘putenv’
     Change the session&#39;s environment to be passed via gpg-agent to
     Pinentry.  VALUE is a string of the form ‘&lt;KEY&gt;[=[&lt;STRING&gt;]]’.  If
     only ‘&lt;KEY&gt;’ is given the environment variable ‘&lt;KEY&gt;’ is removed
     from the session environment, if ‘&lt;KEY&gt;=’ is given that environment
     variable is set to the empty string, and if ‘&lt;STRING&gt;’ is given it
     is set to that string.

‘display’
     Set the session environment variable ‘DISPLAY’ is set to VALUE.
‘ttyname’
     Set the session environment variable ‘GPG_TTY’ is set to VALUE.
‘ttytype’
     Set the session environment variable ‘TERM’ is set to VALUE.
‘lc-ctype’
     Set the session environment variable ‘LC_CTYPE’ is set to VALUE.
‘lc-messages’
     Set the session environment variable ‘LC_MESSAGES’ is set to VALUE.
‘xauthority’
     Set the session environment variable ‘XAUTHORITY’ is set to VALUE.
‘pinentry-user-data’
     Set the session environment variable ‘PINENTRY_USER_DATA’ is set to
     VALUE.

‘include-certs’
     This option overrides the command line option ‘--include-certs’.  A
     VALUE of -2 includes all certificates except for the root
     certificate, -1 includes all certificates, 0 does not include any
     certificates, 1 includes only the signers certificate and all other
     positive values include up to VALUE certificates starting with the
     signer cert.

‘list-mode’
     *Note gpgsm-cmd listkeys::.

‘list-to-output’
     If VALUE is true the output of the list commands (*note gpgsm-cmd
     listkeys::) is written to the file descriptor set with the last
     ‘OUTPUT’ command.  If VALUE is false the output is written via data
     lines; this is the default.

‘with-validation’
     If VALUE is true for each listed certificate the validation status
     is printed.  This may result in the download of a CRL or the user
     being asked about the trustworthiness of a root certificate.  The
     default is given by a command line option (*note gpgsm-option
     --with-validation::).

‘with-secret’
     If VALUE is true certificates with a corresponding private key are
     marked by the list commands.

‘validation-model’
     This option overrides the command line option ‘validation-model’
     for the session.  (*Note gpgsm-option --validation-model::.)

‘with-key-data’
     This option globally enables the command line option
     ‘--with-key-data’.  (*Note gpgsm-option --with-key-data::.)

‘enable-audit-log’
     If VALUE is true data to write an audit log is gathered.  (*Note
     gpgsm-cmd getauditlog::.)

‘allow-pinentry-notify’
     If this option is used notifications about the launch of a Pinentry
     are passed back to the client.

‘with-ephemeral-keys’
     If VALUE is true ephemeral certificates are included in the output
     of the list commands.

‘no-encrypt-to’
     If this option is used all keys set by the command line option
     ‘--encrypt-to’ are ignored.

‘offline’
     If VALUE is true or VALUE is not given all network access is
     disabled for this session.  This is the same as the command line
     option ‘--disable-dirmngr’.

‘always-trust’
     If VALUE is true or VALUE is not given encryption to the specified
     certificates is forced without any validation of the certificate
     chain.  The only requirement is that the certificates are capable
     of encryption.  If set to false the standard behaviour is
     re-established.  This option is cleared by a RESET and after each
     encrypt operation.  Note that this option is ignored if
     ‘--always-trust’ or ‘--require-compliance’ are used.

‘input-size-hint’
     This is the same as the ‘--input-size-hint’ command line option.

6.1 Commands
============

Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that
only one command is allowed.

‘--version’
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--help, -h’
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--dump-options’
     Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--server’
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the ‘stdin’.  The
     default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.

‘--multi-server’
     Run in server mode and wait for commands on the ‘stdin’ as well as
     on an additional Unix Domain socket.  The server command ‘GETINFO’
     may be used to get the name of that extra socket.

‘--daemon’
     Run the program in the background.  This option is required to
     prevent it from being accidentally running in the background.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon Options,  Next: Card applications,  Prev: Scdaemon Commands,  Up: Invoking SCDAEMON

6.2 Option Summary
==================

‘--options FILE’
     Reads configuration from FILE instead of from the default per-user
     configuration file.  The default configuration file is named
     ‘scdaemon.conf’ and expected in the ‘.gnupg’ directory directly
     below the home directory of the user.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to ‘gpgsm’, such as
     ‘-vv’.

‘--debug-level LEVEL’
     Select the debug level for investigating problems.  LEVEL may be a
     numeric value or a keyword:

     ‘none’
          No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used
          instead of the keyword.
     ‘basic’
          Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘advanced’
          More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘expert’
          Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be
          used instead of the keyword.
     ‘guru’
          All of the debug messages you can get.  A value greater than 8
          may be used instead of the keyword.  The creation of hash
          tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

     How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not
     specified and may change with newer releases of this program.  They
     are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

          Note: All debugging options are subject to change and thus
          should not be used by any application program.  As the name
          says, they are only used as helpers to debug problems.

‘--debug FLAGS’
     Set debug flags.  All flags are or-ed and FLAGS may be given in C
     syntax (e.g.  0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.
     To get a list of all supported flags the single word &quot;help&quot; can be
     used.  This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior
     may change at any time without notice.

‘--debug-all’
     Same as ‘--debug=0xffffffff’

‘--debug-wait N’
     When running in server mode, wait N seconds before entering the
     actual processing loop and print the pid.  This gives time to
     attach a debugger.

‘--debug-ccid-driver’
     Enable debug output from the included CCID driver for smartcards.
     Using this option twice will also enable some tracing of the T=1
     protocol.  Note that this option may reveal sensitive data.

‘--debug-disable-ticker’
     This option disables all ticker functions like checking for card
     insertions.

‘--debug-allow-core-dump’
     For security reasons we won&#39;t create a core dump when the process
     aborts.  For debugging purposes it is sometimes better to allow
     core dump.  This option enables it and also changes the working
     directory to ‘/tmp’ when running in ‘--server’ mode.

‘--debug-log-tid’
     This option appends a thread ID to the PID in the log output.

‘--debug-assuan-log-cats CATS’
     Changes the active Libassuan logging categories to CATS.  The value
     for CATS is an unsigned integer given in usual C-Syntax.  A value
     of 0 switches to a default category.  If this option is not used
     the categories are taken from the environment variable
     ‘ASSUAN_DEBUG’.  Note that this option has only an effect if the
     Assuan debug flag has also been with the option ‘--debug’.  For a
     list of categories see the Libassuan manual.

‘--no-detach’
     Don&#39;t detach the process from the console.  This is mainly useful
     for debugging.

‘--listen-backlog N’
     Set the size of the queue for pending connections.  The default is
     64.  This option has an effect only if ‘--multi-server’ is also
     used.

‘--log-file FILE’
     Append all logging output to FILE.  This is very helpful in seeing
     what the agent actually does.  Use ‘socket://’ to log to socket.

‘--pcsc-shared’
     Use shared mode to access the card via PC/SC. This is a somewhat
     dangerous option because Scdaemon assumes exclusive access to the
     card and for example caches certain information from the card.  Use
     this option only if you know what you are doing.

‘--pcsc-driver LIBRARY’
     Use LIBRARY to access the smartcard reader.  The current default on
     Unix is ‘libpcsclite.so’ and on Windows ‘winscard.dll’.  Instead of
     using this option you might also want to install a symbolic link to
     the default file name (e.g.  from ‘libpcsclite.so.1’).  A Unicode
     file name may not be used on Windows.

‘--disable-ccid’
     The integrated CCID driver for CCID compliant devices can be
     available when libusb was detected at build time, and it is used to
     access the smartcard reader.  If access via PC/SC driver is needed,
     please configure this option to disable CCID driver support (if
     any).  In GnuPG 2.2, there was a fallback mechanism from CCID
     driver to PC/SC driver.  The fallback mechanism worked, because
     scdaemon in GnuPG 2.2 only supported a single token/reader.  To
     support of multiple tokens/readers at the same time, fallback
     mechanism was removed.

‘--reader-port NUMBER_OR_STRING’
     This option may be used to specify the port of the card terminal.
     A value of 0 refers to the first serial device; add 32768 to access
     USB devices.  The default is 32768 (first USB device).  PC/SC or
     CCID readers might need a string here; run the program in verbose
     mode to get a list of available readers.  The default is then the
     first reader found.

     To get a list of available CCID readers you may use this command:
            echo scd getinfo reader_list \
              | gpg-connect-agent --decode | awk &#39;/^D/ {print $2}&#39;

‘--card-timeout N’
     This option is deprecated.  In GnuPG 2.0, it used to be used for
     DISCONNECT command to control timing issue.  Since DISCONNECT
     command works synchronously, it has no effect.

‘--enable-pinpad-varlen’
     Please specify this option when the card reader supports variable
     length input for pinpad (default is no).  For known readers (listed
     in ccid-driver.c and apdu.c), this option is not needed.  Note that
     if your card reader doesn&#39;t supports variable length input but you
     want to use it, you need to specify your pinpad request on your
     card.

‘--disable-pinpad’
     Even if a card reader features a pinpad, do not try to use it.

‘--deny-admin’
     This option disables the use of admin class commands for card
     applications where this is supported.  Currently we support it for
     the OpenPGP card.  This option is useful to inhibit accidental
     access to admin class command which could ultimately lock the card
     through wrong PIN numbers.  Note that GnuPG versions older than
     2.0.11 featured an ‘--allow-admin’ option which was required to use
     such admin commands.  This option has no more effect today because
     the default is now to allow admin commands.

‘--disable-application NAME’
     This option disables the use of the card application named NAME.
     This is mainly useful for debugging or if a application with lower
     priority should be used by default.

‘--application-priority NAMELIST’
     This option allows one to change the order in which applications of
     a card a tried if no specific application was requested.  NAMELIST
     is a space or comma delimited list of application names.  Unknown
     names are simply skipped.  Applications not mentioned in the list
     are put in the former order at the end of the new priority list.

     To get the list of current active applications, use
              gpg-connect-agent &#39;scd getinfo app_list&#39; /bye

   All the long options may also be given in the configuration file
after stripping off the two leading dashes.

This application is currently only used by ‘gpg’ but may in future also
be useful with ‘gpgsm’.  Version 1 and version 2 of the card is
supported.

The specifications for these cards are available at
&lt;http://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-1.0.pdf&gt; and
&lt;http://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-2.0.pdf&gt;.

6.3.3 The DINSIG card application &quot;dinsig&quot;
------------------------------------------

This is an application as described in the German draft standard _DIN V
66291-1_.  It is intended to be used by cards supporting the German
signature law and its bylaws (SigG and SigV).

6.3.4 The PKCS#15 card application &quot;p15&quot;
----------------------------------------

This is common framework for smart card applications.  It is used by
‘gpgsm’.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Geldkarte Card,  Next: SmartCard-HSM,  Prev: PKCS#15 Card,  Up: Card applications

6.3.5 The Geldkarte card application &quot;geldkarte&quot;
------------------------------------------------

This is a simple application to display information of a German
Geldkarte.  The Geldkarte is a small amount debit card application which
comes with almost all German banking cards.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: SmartCard-HSM,  Next: Undefined Card,  Prev: Geldkarte Card,  Up: Card applications

6.3.6 The SmartCard-HSM card application &quot;sc-hsm&quot;
-------------------------------------------------

This application adds read-only support for keys and certificates stored
on a SmartCard-HSM (http://www.smartcard-hsm.com).

   To generate keys and store certificates you may use OpenSC
(https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM) or the tools from
OpenSCDP (http://www.openscdp.org).

   The SmartCard-HSM cards requires a card reader that supports Extended
Length APDUs.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Undefined Card,  Prev: SmartCard-HSM,  Up: Card applications

6.3.7 The Undefined card application &quot;undefined&quot;
------------------------------------------------

This is a stub application to allow the use of the APDU command even if
no supported application is found on the card.  This application is not
used automatically but must be explicitly requested using the SERIALNO
command.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon Configuration,  Next: Scdaemon Examples,  Prev: Card applications,  Up: Invoking SCDAEMON

6.4 Configuration files
=======================

There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of
‘scdaemons’&#39;s operation.  Unless noted, they are expected in the current
home directory (*note option --homedir::).

‘scdaemon.conf’
     This is the standard configuration file read by ‘scdaemon’ on
     startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two
     dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
     This default name may be changed on the command line (*note option
     --options::).

‘scd-event’
     If this file is present and executable, it will be called on every
     card reader&#39;s status change.  An example of this script is provided
     with the source code distribution.  This option is deprecated in
     favor of the ‘DEVINFO --watch’.

‘reader_N.status’
     This file is created by ‘scdaemon’ to let other applications now
     about reader status changes.  Its use is now deprecated in favor of
     ‘scd-event’.

6.5 Examples
============

     $ scdaemon --server -v

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon Protocol,  Prev: Scdaemon Examples,  Up: Invoking SCDAEMON

6.6 Scdaemon&#39;s Assuan Protocol
==============================

The SC-Daemon should be started by the system to provide access to
external tokens.  Using Smartcards on a multi-user system does not make
much sense except for system services, but in this case no regular user
accounts are hosted on the machine.

   A client connects to the SC-Daemon by connecting to the socket named
‘/var/run/gnupg/scdaemon/socket’, configuration information is read from
/ETC/GNUPG/SCDAEMON.CONF

   Each connection acts as one session, SC-Daemon takes care of
synchronizing access to a token between sessions.

* Menu:

* Scdaemon SERIALNO::     Return the serial number.
* Scdaemon LEARN::        Read all useful information from the card.
* Scdaemon READCERT::     Return a certificate.

6.6.1 Return the serial number
------------------------------

This command should be used to check for the presence of a card.  It is
special in that it can be used to reset the card.  Most other commands
will return an error when a card change has been detected and the use of
this function is therefore required.

   Background: We want to keep the client clear of handling card changes
between operations; i.e.  the client can assume that all operations are
done on the same card unless he call this function.

       SERIALNO

   Return the serial number of the card using a status response like:

       S SERIALNO D27600000000000000000000

   The serial number is the hex encoded value identified by the ‘0x5A’
tag in the GDO file (FIX=0x2F02).

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon LEARN,  Next: Scdaemon READCERT,  Prev: Scdaemon SERIALNO,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.2 Read all useful information from the card
-----------------------------------------------

       LEARN [--force]

   Learn all useful information of the currently inserted card.  When
used without the ‘--force’ option, the command might do an INQUIRE like
this:

           INQUIRE KNOWNCARDP &lt;hexstring_with_serialNumber&gt;

   The client should just send an ‘END’ if the processing should go on
or a ‘CANCEL’ to force the function to terminate with a cancel error
message.  The response of this command is a list of status lines
formatted as this:

          S KEYPAIRINFO HEXSTRING_WITH_KEYGRIP HEXSTRING_WITH_ID

   If there is no certificate yet stored on the card a single &quot;X&quot; is
returned in HEXSTRING_WITH_KEYGRIP.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon READCERT,  Next: Scdaemon READKEY,  Prev: Scdaemon LEARN,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.3 Return a certificate
--------------------------

      READCERT HEXIFIED_CERTID|KEYID

   This function is used to read a certificate identified by
HEXIFIED_CERTID from the card.  With OpenPGP cards the keyid ‘OpenPGP.3’
may be used to read the certificate of version 2 cards.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon READKEY,  Next: Scdaemon PKSIGN,  Prev: Scdaemon READCERT,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.4 Return a public key
-------------------------

     READKEY HEXIFIED_CERTID

   Return the public key for the given cert or key ID as an standard
S-Expression.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon PKSIGN,  Next: Scdaemon PKDECRYPT,  Prev: Scdaemon READKEY,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.5 Signing data with a Smartcard
-----------------------------------

To sign some data the caller should use the command

      SETDATA HEXSTRING

   to tell ‘scdaemon’ about the data to be signed.  The data must be
given in hex notation.  The actual signing is done using the command

       PKSIGN KEYID

   where KEYID is the hexified ID of the key to be used.  The key id may
have been retrieved using the command ‘LEARN’.  If another hash
algorithm than SHA-1 is used, that algorithm may be given like:

       PKSIGN --hash=ALGONAME KEYID

   With ALGONAME are one of ‘sha1’, ‘rmd160’ or ‘md5’.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon PKDECRYPT,  Next: Scdaemon GETATTR,  Prev: Scdaemon PKSIGN,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.6 Decrypting data with a Smartcard
--------------------------------------

To decrypt some data the caller should use the command

      SETDATA HEXSTRING

   to tell ‘scdaemon’ about the data to be decrypted.  The data must be
given in hex notation.  The actual decryption is then done using the
command

       PKDECRYPT KEYID

   where KEYID is the hexified ID of the key to be used.

   If the card is aware of the apdding format a status line with padding
information is send before the plaintext data.  The key for this status
line is ‘PADDING’ with the only defined value being 0 and meaning
padding has been removed.

6.6.7 Read an attribute&#39;s value
-------------------------------

TO BE WRITTEN.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon SETATTR,  Next: Scdaemon WRITEKEY,  Prev: Scdaemon GETATTR,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.8 Update an attribute&#39;s value
---------------------------------

TO BE WRITTEN.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon WRITEKEY,  Next: Scdaemon GENKEY,  Prev: Scdaemon SETATTR,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.9 Write a key to a card
---------------------------

       WRITEKEY [--force] KEYID

   This command is used to store a secret key on a smartcard.  The
allowed keyids depend on the currently selected smartcard application.
The actual keydata is requested using the inquiry ‘KEYDATA’ and need to
be provided without any protection.  With ‘--force’ set an existing key
under this KEYID will get overwritten.  The key data is expected to be
the usual canonical encoded S-expression.

   A PIN will be requested in most cases.  This however depends on the
actual card application.

6.6.10 Generate a new key on-card
---------------------------------

TO BE WRITTEN.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon RANDOM,  Next: Scdaemon PASSWD,  Prev: Scdaemon GENKEY,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.11 Return random bytes generated on-card
--------------------------------------------

TO BE WRITTEN.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon PASSWD,  Next: Scdaemon CHECKPIN,  Prev: Scdaemon RANDOM,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.12 Change PINs
------------------

        PASSWD [--reset] [--nullpin] CHVNO

   Change the PIN or reset the retry counter of the card holder
verification vector number CHVNO.  The option ‘--nullpin’ is used to
initialize the PIN of TCOS cards (6 byte NullPIN only).

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon CHECKPIN,  Next: Scdaemon RESTART,  Prev: Scdaemon PASSWD,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.13 Perform a VERIFY operation
---------------------------------

       CHECKPIN IDSTR

   Perform a VERIFY operation without doing anything else.  This may be
used to initialize a the PIN cache earlier to long lasting operations.
Its use is highly application dependent:

*OpenPGP*

     Perform a simple verify operation for CHV1 and CHV2, so that
     further operations won&#39;t ask for CHV2 and it is possible to do a
     cheap check on the PIN: If there is something wrong with the PIN
     entry system, only the regular CHV will get blocked and not the
     dangerous CHV3.  IDSTR is the usual card&#39;s serial number in hex
     notation; an optional fingerprint part will get ignored.

     There is however a special mode if IDSTR is suffixed with the
     literal string ‘[CHV3]’: In this case the Admin PIN is checked if
     and only if the retry counter is still at 3.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon RESTART,  Next: Scdaemon APDU,  Prev: Scdaemon CHECKPIN,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.14 Perform a RESTART operation
----------------------------------

       RESTART

   Restart the current connection; this is a kind of warm reset.  It
deletes the context used by this connection but does not actually reset
the card.

   This is used by gpg-agent to reuse a primary pipe connection and may
be used by clients to backup from a conflict in the serial command; i.e.
to select another application.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Scdaemon APDU,  Prev: Scdaemon RESTART,  Up: Scdaemon Protocol

6.6.15 Send a verbatim APDU to the card
---------------------------------------

       APDU [--atr] [--more] [--exlen[=N]] [HEXSTRING]

   Send an APDU to the current reader.  This command bypasses the high
level functions and sends the data directly to the card.  HEXSTRING is
expected to be a proper APDU. If HEXSTRING is not given no commands are
send to the card; However the command will implicitly check whether the
card is ready for use.

   Using the option ‘--atr’ returns the ATR of the card as a status
message before any data like this:
          S CARD-ATR 3BFA1300FF813180450031C173C00100009000B1

   Using the option ‘--more’ handles the card status word MORE_DATA
(61xx) and concatenate all responses to one block.

   Using the option ‘--exlen’ the returned APDU may use extended length
up to N bytes.  If N is not given a default value is used (currently
4096).

7 How to Specify a User Id
**************************

There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some of them are
only valid for ‘gpg’ others are only good for ‘gpgsm’.  Here is the
entire list of ways to specify a key:

   • By key Id.  This format is deduced from the length of the string
     and its content or ‘0x’ prefix.  The key Id of an X.509 certificate
     are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids
     is just a shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint
     should be used.

     When using ‘gpg’ an exclamation mark (!)  may be appended to force
     using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
     calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

     The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long
     form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol.  You can see the
     long key ID using the option ‘--with-colons’.

          234567C4
          0F34E556E
          01347A56A
          0xAB123456

          234AABBCC34567C4
          0F323456784E56EAB
          01AB3FED1347A5612
          0x234AABBCC34567C4

   • By fingerprint.  This format is deduced from the length of the
     string and its content or the ‘0x’ prefix.  Note, that only the 20
     byte version fingerprint is available with ‘gpgsm’ (i.e.  the SHA-1
     hash of the certificate).

     When using ‘gpg’ an exclamation mark (!)  may be appended to force
     using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and
     calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

     The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint.  This
     avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated key IDs.

          1234343434343434C434343434343434
          123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434
          0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
          0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434

     ‘gpgsm’ also accepts colons between each pair of hexadecimal digits
     because this is the de-facto standard on how to present X.509
     fingerprints.  ‘gpg’ also allows the use of the space separated
     SHA-1 fingerprint as printed by the key listing commands.

   • By exact match on OpenPGP user ID. This is denoted by a leading
     equal sign.  It does not make sense for X.509 certificates.

          =Heinrich Heine &lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;

   • By exact match on an email address.  This is indicated by enclosing
     the email address in the usual way with left and right angles.

          &lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;

   • By partial match on an email address.  This is indicated by
     prefixing the search string with an ‘@’.  This uses a substring
     search but considers only the mail address (i.e.  inside the angle
     brackets).

          @heinrichh

   • By exact match on the subject&#39;s DN. This is indicated by a leading
     slash, directly followed by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the subject.
     Note that you can&#39;t use the string printed by ‘gpgsm --list-keys’
     because that one has been reordered and modified for better
     readability; use ‘--with-colons’ to print the raw (but standard
     escaped) RFC-2253 string.

          /CN=Heinrich Heine,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   • By exact match on the issuer&#39;s DN. This is indicated by a leading
     hash mark, directly followed by a slash and then directly followed
     by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the issuer.  This should return the
     Root cert of the issuer.  See note above.

          #/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   • By exact match on serial number and issuer&#39;s DN. This is indicated
     by a hash mark, followed by the hexadecimal representation of the
     serial number, then followed by a slash and the RFC-2253 encoded DN
     of the issuer.  See note above.

          #4F03/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

   • By keygrip.  This is indicated by an ampersand followed by the 40
     hex digits of a keygrip.  ‘gpgsm’ prints the keygrip when using the
     command ‘--dump-cert’.

          &amp;D75F22C3F86E355877348498CDC92BD21010A480

   • By substring match.  This is the default mode but applications may
     want to explicitly indicate this by putting the asterisk in front.
     Match is not case sensitive.

          Heine

   • .  and + prefixes These prefixes are reserved for looking up mails
     anchored at the end and for a word search mode.  They are not yet
     implemented and using them is undefined.

   Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was
used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-id.  It is
not anymore used and there should be no conflict when used with X.509
stuff.

   Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not
possible to map them back to the original encoding, however we don&#39;t
have to do this because our key database stores this encoding as meta
data.

9 Smart Card Tool
*****************

GnuPG comes with a tool to administrate smart cards and USB tokens.
This tool is an enhanced version of the ‘--edit-key’ command available
with ‘gpg’.

* Menu:

* gpg-card::             Administrate smart cards.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpg-card,  Up: Smart Card Tool

9.1 Administrate smart cards.
=============================

The ‘gpg-card’ is used to administrate smart cards and USB tokens.  It
provides a superset of features from ‘gpg --card-edit’ an can be
considered a frontend to ‘scdaemon’ which is a daemon started by
‘gpg-agent’ to handle smart cards.

   If ‘gpg-card’ is invoked without commands an interactive mode is
used.

   If ‘gpg-card’ is invoked with one or more commands the same commands
as available in the interactive mode are run from the command line.
These commands need to be delimited with a double-dash.  If a
double-dash or a shell specific character is required as part of a
command the entire command needs to be put in quotes.  If one of those
commands returns an error the remaining commands are not anymore run
unless the command was prefixed with a single dash.

   A list of commands is available by using the command ‘help’ and a
brief description of each command is printed by using ‘help CMD’.  See
the section COMMANDS for a full description.

   See the NOTES sections for instructions pertaining to specific cards
or card applications.

‘gpg-card’ understands these options:

‘--with-colons’
     This option has currently no effect.

‘--status-fd N’
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  This
     program returns only the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which
     are helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can&#39;t
     easily get the return code of the process.

‘--verbose’
     Enable extra informational output.

‘--quiet’
     Disable almost all informational output.

‘--version’
     Print version of the program and exit.

‘--help’
     Display a brief help page and exit.

‘--no-autostart’
     Do not start the gpg-agent if it has not yet been started and its
     service is required.  This option is mostly useful on machines
     where the connection to gpg-agent has been redirected to another
     machines.

‘--no-history’
     In interactive mode the command line history is usually saved and
     restored to and from a file below the GnuPG home directory.  This
     option inhibits the use of that file.

‘--agent-program FILE’
     Specify the agent program to be started if none is running.  The
     default value is determined by running ‘gpgconf’ with the option
     ‘--list-dirs’.

‘--gpg-program FILE’
     Specify a non-default gpg binary to be used by certain commands.

‘--gpgsm-program FILE’
     Specify a non-default gpgsm binary to be used by certain commands.

‘--chuid UID’
     Change the current user to UID which may either be a number or a
     name.  This can be used from the root account to run gpg-card for
     another user.  If UID is not the current UID a standard PATH is set
     and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the
     option ‘--homedir’ can be used.  This option has only an effect
     when used on the command line.  This option has currently no effect
     at all on Windows.

‘gpg-card’ understands the following commands, which have options of
their own.  The pseudo-option ‘--’ can be used to separate command
options from arguments; if this pseudo option is used on the command
line the entire command with options and arguments must be quoted, so
that it is not mixed up with the ‘--’ as used on the command line to
separate commands.  Note that a short online help is available for all
commands by prefixing them with &quot;help&quot;.  Command completion in the
interactive mode is also supported.

‘AUTHENTICATE [--setkey] [--raw] [&lt; FILE]|KEY]’
‘AUTH’
     Authenticate to the card.  Perform a mutual authentication either
     by reading the key from FILE or by taking it from the command line
     as KEY.  Without the option ‘--raw’ the key is expected to be hex
     encoded.  To install a new administration key ‘--setkey’ is used;
     this requires a prior authentication with the old key.  This is
     used with PIV cards.

‘CAFPR [--clear] N’
     Change the CA fingerprint number N of an OpenPGP card.  N must be
     in the range 1 to 3.  The option ‘--clear’ clears the specified CA
     fingerprint N or all of them if N is 0 or not given.

‘FACTORY-RESET’
     Do a complete reset of some OpenPGP and PIV cards.  This command
     deletes all data and keys and resets the PINs to their default.
     Don&#39;t worry, you need to confirm before the command proceeds.

‘FETCH’
     Retrieve a key using the URL data object of an OpenPGP card or if
     that is missing using the stored fingerprint.

‘FORCESIG’
     Toggle the forcesig flag of an OpenPGP card.

‘GENERATE [--force] [--algo=ALGO{+ALGO2}] KEYREF’
     Create a new key on a card.  Use ‘--force’ to overwrite an existing
     key.  Use &quot;help&quot; for ALGO to get a list of known algorithms.  For
     OpenPGP cards several algos may be given.  Note that the OpenPGP
     key generation is done interactively unless ‘--algo’ or KEYREF are
     given.

‘KDF-SETUP’
     Prepare the OpenPGP card KDF feature for this card.

‘LANG [--clear]’
     Change the language info for the card.  This info can be used by
     applications for a personalized greeting.  Up to 4 two-digit
     language identifiers can be entered as a preference.  The option
     ‘--clear’ removes all identifiers.  GnuPG does not use this info.

‘LIST [--cards] [--apps] [--info] [--no-key-lookup] [N] [APP]’
‘L’
     This command reads all information from the current card and
     display them in a human readable format.  The first section shows
     generic information vaialable for all cards.  The next section
     shows information pertaining to keys which depend on the actual
     card and application.

     With N given select and list the n-th card; with APP also given
     select that application.  To select an APP on the current card use
     &quot;-&quot; for N.  The serial number of the card may be used instead of N.

     The option ‘--cards’ lists the serial numbers of available cards.
     The option ‘--apps’ lists all card applications.  The option
     ‘--info’ selects a card and prints its serial number.  The option
     ‘--no-key-lookup’ suppresses the listing of matching OpenPGP or
     X.509 keys.

‘LOGIN [--clear] [&lt; FILE]’
     Set the login data object of OpenPGP cards.  If FILE is given the
     data is is read from that file.  This allows one to store binary
     data in the login field.  The option ‘--clear’ deletes the login
     data object.

‘NAME [--clear]’
     Set the name field of an OpenPGP card.  With option ‘--clear’ the
     stored name is cleared off the card.

‘PASSWD [--reset|--nullpin] [PINREF]’
     Change or unblock the PINs.  Note that in interactive mode and
     without a PINREF a menu is presented for certain cards.&quot;  In
     non-interactive mode and without a PINREF a default value i used
     for these cards.  The option ‘--reset’ is used with TCOS cards to
     reset the PIN using the PUK or vice versa; the option -NULLPIN is
     used for these cards to set the initial PIN.

‘PRIVATEDO [--clear] N [&lt; FILE]’
     Change the private data object N of an OpenPGP card.  N must be in
     the range 1 to 4.  If FILE is given the data is is read from that
     file.  The option ‘--clear’ clears the data.

‘QUIT’
‘Q’
     Stop processing and terminate ‘gpg-card’.

‘READCERT [--openpgp] CERTREF &gt; FILE’
     Read the certificate for key CERTREF and store it in FILE.  With
     option ‘--openpgp’ an OpenPGP keyblock wrapped in a dedicated CMS
     content type (OID=1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.2.3.1) is expected and
     extracted to FILE.  Note that for current OpenPGP cards a
     certificate may only be available at the CERTREF &quot;OPENPGP.3&quot;.

‘RESET’
     Send a reset to the card daemon.

‘SALUTATION [--clear]’
‘SALUT’
     Change the salutation info for the card.  This info can be used by
     applications for a personalized greeting.  The option ‘--clear’
     removes this data object.  GnuPG does not use this info.

‘UIF N [on|off|permanent]’
     Change the User Interaction Flag.  That flags tells whether the
     confirmation button of a token shall be used.  N must in the range
     1 to 3.  &quot;permanent&quot; is the same as &quot;on&quot; but the flag can&#39;t be
     changed anmore.

‘UNBLOCK’
     Unblock a PIN using a PUK or Reset Code.  Note that OpenPGP cards
     prior to version 2 can&#39;t use this; instead the ‘PASSWD’ can be used
     to set a new PIN.

‘URL [--clear]’
     Set the URL data object of an OpenPGP card.  That data object can
     be used by by ‘gpg’&#39;s ‘--fetch’ command to retrieve the full public
     key.  The option ‘--clear’ deletes the content of that data object.

‘VERIFY [CHVID]’
     Verify the PIN identified by CHVID or the default PIN.

‘WRITECERT CERTREF &lt; FILE’
‘WRITECERT --openpgp CERTREF [&lt; FILE|FPR]’
‘WRITECERT --clear CERTREF’
     Write a certificate to the card under the id CERTREF.  The option
     ‘--clear’ removes the certificate from the card.  The option
     ‘--openpgp’ expects an OpenPGP keyblock and stores it encapsulated
     in a CMS container; the keyblock is taken from FILE or directly
     from the OpenPGP key identified by fingerprint FPR.

‘WRITEKEY [--force] KEYREF KEYGRIP’
     Write a private key object identified by KEYGRIP to the card under
     the id KEYREF.  Option ‘--force’ allows overwriting an existing
     key.

‘CHECKKEYS [--ondisk] [--delete-clear-copy] [--delete-protected-copy]’
     Print a list of keys noticed on all inserted cards.  With
     ‘--ondisk’ only smartcard keys with a copy on disk are listed.
     With ‘--delete-clear-copy’ copies of smartcard keys stored on disk
     without any protection will be deleted.  With
     ‘--delete-protected-copy’ password protected copies of smartcard
     keys stored on disk will be deleted.

     This command creates missing shadow keys.  The delete options print
     the status of the keys before they are deleted.

     The format of the output is:
     SERIAL NUMBER
          A hex-string with the serial number of the card.
     TYPE
          This gives the type of the card&#39;s application.  For example
          &quot;OpenPGP&quot; or &quot;PIV&quot;.
     KEYGRIP
          A hex-string identifying a key.
     KEYREF
          The application slot where the key is stored on the card.  For
          example &quot;OpenPGP.1&quot;
     STATUS
          The status of the key.  The most common value is &quot;shadowed&quot;
          for a key where only the public key along with the card&#39;s
          serial number is stored on the disk.  The value &quot;clear&quot;
          indicates that a copy of the card&#39;s key is stored unprotected
          on disk.  The value &quot;protected&quot; indicated that a copy of the
          car&#39;s key is stored on disk but is protected by a password.
          The value &quot;error&quot; may also be shown if there was a problem
          reading information from the card.

‘YUBIKEY CMD ARGS’
     Various commands pertaining to Yubikey tokens with CMD being:
     LIST
          List supported and enabled Yubikey applications.
     ENABLE USB|NFC|ALL [OTP|U2F|OPGP|PIV|OATH|FIDO2|ALL]
     DISABLE
          Enable or disable the specified or all applications on the
          given interface.

   The support for OpenPGP cards in ‘gpg-card’ is not yet complete.  For
missing features, please continue to use ‘gpg --card-edit’.

GnuPG has support for PIV cards (&quot;Personal Identity Verification&quot; as
specified by NIST Special Publication 800-73-4).  This section describes
how to initialize (personalize) a fresh Yubikey token featuring the PIV
application (requires Yubikey-5).  We assume that the credentials have
not yet been changed and thus are:
Authentication key
     This is a 24 byte key described by the hex string
     ‘010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708’.
PIV Application PIN
     This is the string ‘123456’.
PIN Unblocking Key
     This is the string ‘12345678’.
   See the example section on how to change these defaults.  For
production use it is important to use secure values for them.  Note that
the Authentication Key is not queried via the usual Pinentry dialog but
needs to be entered manually or read from a file.  The use of a
dedicated machine to personalize tokens is strongly suggested.

   To see what is on the card, the command ‘list’ can be given.  We will
use the interactive mode in the following (the string _gpg/card&gt;_ is the
prompt).  An example output for a fresh card is:

     gpg/card&gt; list
     Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
     Card type ........: yubikey
     Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
     Serial number ....: D2760001240102010006090746250000
     Application type .: OpenPGP
     Version ..........: 2.1
     [...]

   It can be seen by the &quot;Application type&quot; line that GnuPG selected the
OpenPGP application of the Yubikey.  This is because GnuPG assigns the
highest priority to the OpenPGP application.  To use the PIV application
of the Yubikey several methods can be used:

   With a Yubikey 5 or later the OpenPGP application on the Yubikey can
be disabled:

     gpg/card&gt; yubikey disable all opgp
     gpg/card&gt; yubikey list
     Application  USB    NFC
     -----------------------
     OTP          yes    yes
     U2F          yes    yes
     OPGP         no     no
     PIV          yes    no
     OATH         yes    yes
     FIDO2        yes    yes
     gpg/card&gt; reset

   The ‘reset’ is required so that the GnuPG system rereads the card.
Note that disabled applications keep all their data and can at any time
be re-enabled (use ‘help yubikey’).

   Another option, which works for all Yubikey versions, is to disable
the support for OpenPGP cards in scdaemon.  This is done by adding the
line

     disable-application openpgp

   to ‘~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf’ and by restarting scdaemon, either by
killing the process or by using ‘gpgconf --kill scdaemon’.  Finally the
default order in which card applications are tried by scdaemon can be
changed.  For example to prefer PIV over OpenPGP it is sufficient to add

     application-priority piv

   to ‘~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf’ and to restart ‘scdaemon’.  This has an
effect only on tokens which support both, PIV and OpenPGP, but does not
hamper the use of OpenPGP only tokens.

   With one of these methods employed the ‘list’ command of ‘gpg-card’
shows this:

     gpg/card&gt; list
     Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
     Card type ........: yubikey
     Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
     Serial number ....: FF020001008A77C1
     Application type .: PIV
     Version ..........: 1.0
     Displayed s/n ....: yk-9074625
     PIN usage policy .: app-pin
     PIN retry counter : - 3 -
     PIV authentication: [none]
           keyref .....: PIV.9A
     Card authenticat. : [none]
           keyref .....: PIV.9E
     Digital signature : [none]
           keyref .....: PIV.9C
     Key management ...: [none]
           keyref .....: PIV.9D

   In case several tokens are plugged into the computer, gpg-card will
show only one.  To show another token the number of the token (0, 1, 2,
...)  can be given as an argument to the ‘list’ command.  The command
‘list --cards’ prints a list of all inserted tokens.

   Note that the &quot;Displayed s/n&quot; is printed on the token and also shown
in Pinentry prompts asking for the PIN. The four standard key slots are
always shown, if other key slots are initialized they are shown as well.
The _PIV authentication_ key (internal reference _PIV.9A_) is used to
authenticate the card and the card holder.  The use of the associated
private key is protected by the Application PIN which needs to be
provided once and the key can the be used until the card is reset or
removed from the reader or USB port.  GnuPG uses this key with its
_Secure Shell_ support.  The _Card authentication_ key (_PIV.9E_) is
also known as the CAK and used to support physical access applications.
The private key is not protected by a PIN and can thus immediately be
used.  The _Digital signature_ key (_PIV.9C_) is used to digitally sign
documents.  The use of the associated private key is protected by the
Application PIN which needs to be provided for each signing operation.
The _Key management_ key (_PIV.9D_) is used for encryption.  The use of
the associated private key is protected by the Application PIN which
needs to be provided only once so that decryption operations can then be
done until the card is reset or removed from the reader or USB port.

   We now generate three of the four keys.  Note that GnuPG does
currently not use the the _Card authentication_ key; however, that key
is mandatory by the PIV standard and thus we create it too.  Key
generation requires that we authenticate to the card.  This can be done
either on the command line (which would reveal the key):

     gpg/card&gt; auth 010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708

   or by reading the key from a file.  That file needs to consist of one
LF terminated line with the hex encoded key (as above):

     gpg/card&gt; auth &lt; myauth.key

   As usual ‘help auth’ gives help for this command.  An error message
is printed if a non-matching key is used.  The authentication is valid
until a reset of the card or until the card is removed from the reader
or the USB port.  Note that that in non-interactive mode the ‘&lt;’ needs
to be quoted so that the shell does not interpret it as a its own
redirection symbol.

Here are the actual commands to generate the keys:

     gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp384 PIV.9A
     PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
     gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp256 PIV.9E
     PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
     gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=rsa2048 PIV.9C
     PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected

   If a key has already been created for one of the slots an error will
be printed; to create a new key anyway the option ‘--force’ can be used.
Note that only the private and public keys have been created but no
certificates are stored in the key slots.  In fact, GnuPG uses its own
non-standard method to store just the public key in place of the the
certificate.  Other application will not be able to make use these keys
until ‘gpgsm’ or another tool has been used to create and store the
respective certificates.  Let us see what the list command now shows:

     gpg/card&gt; list

   The primary information for each key is the _keygrip_, a 40 byte
hex-string identifying the key.  This keygrip is a unique identifier for
the specific parameters of a key.  It is used by ‘gpg-agent’ and other
parts of GnuPG to associate a private key to its protocol specific
certificate format (X.509, OpenPGP, or SecureShell).  Below the keygrip
the key reference along with the key usage capabilities are show.
Finally the algorithm is printed in the format used by ‘gpg’.  At that
point no other information is shown because for these new keys gpg won&#39;t
be able to find matching certificates.

   Although we could have created the _Key management_ key also with the
generate command, we will create that key off-card so that a backup
exists.  To accomplish this a key needs to be created with either ‘gpg’
or ‘gpgsm’ or imported in one of these tools.  In our example we create
a self-signed X.509 certificate (exit the gpg-card tool, first):

     $ gpgsm --gen-key -o encr.crt
        (1) RSA
        (2) Existing key
        (3) Existing key from card
     Your selection? 1
     What keysize do you want? (3072) 2048
     Requested keysize is 2048 bits
     Possible actions for a RSA key:
        (1) sign, encrypt
        (2) sign
        (3) encrypt
     Your selection? 3
     Enter the X.509 subject name: CN=Encryption key for yk-9074625,O=example,C=DE
     Enter email addresses (end with an empty line):
     &gt; otto@example.net
     &gt;
     Enter DNS names (optional; end with an empty line):
     &gt;
     Enter URIs (optional; end with an empty line):
     &gt;
     Create self-signed certificate? (y/N) y
     These parameters are used:
         Key-Type: RSA
         Key-Length: 2048
         Key-Usage: encrypt
         Serial: random
         Name-DN: CN=Encryption key for yk-9074625,O=example,C=DE
         Name-Email: otto@example.net

     Proceed with creation? (y/N)
     Now creating self-signed certificate.  This may take a while ...
     gpgsm: about to sign the certificate for key: &amp;34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
     gpgsm: certificate created
     Ready.
     $ gpgsm --import encr.crt
     gpgsm: certificate imported
     gpgsm: total number processed: 1
     gpgsm:               imported: 1

   Note the last step which imported the created certificate.  If you
you instead created a certificate signing request (CSR) instead of a
self-signed certificate and sent this off to a CA you would do the same
import step with the certificate received from the CA. Take note of the
keygrip (prefixed with an ampersand) as shown during the certificate
creation or listed it again using ‘gpgsm --with-keygrip -k
otto@example.net’.  Now to move the key and certificate to the card
start ‘gpg-card’ again and enter:

     gpg/card&gt; writekey PIV.9D 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
     gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9D &lt; encr.crt

   If you entered a passphrase to protect the private key, you will be
asked for it via the Pinentry prompt.  On success the key and the
certificate has been written to the card and a ‘list’ command shows:

     [...]
     Key management ...: 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
           keyref .....: PIV.9D  (encr)

             user id ..: &lt;otto@example.net&gt;

   In case the same key (identified by the keygrip) has been used for
several certificates you will see several &quot;used for&quot; parts.  With this
the encryption key is now fully functional and can be used to decrypt
messages encrypted to this certificate.  TAKE CARE: the original key is
still stored on-disk and should be moved to a backup medium.  This can
simply be done by copying the file
‘34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB.key’ from the directory
‘~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/’ to the backup medium and deleting the file
at its original place.

   The final example is to create a self-signed certificate for digital
signatures.  Leave ‘gpg-card’ using ‘quit’ or by pressing Control-D and
use gpgsm:

     $ gpgsm --learn
     $ gpgsm --gen-key -o sign.crt

     Now creating self-signed certificate.  This may take a while ...

   The use of ‘gpgsm --learn’ is currently necessary so that gpg-agent
knows what keys are available on the card.  The need for this command
will eventually be removed.  The remaining commands are similar to the
creation of an on-disk key.  However, here we select the ‘Digital
signature’ key.  During the creation process you will be asked for the
Application PIN of the card.  The final step is to write the certificate
to the card using ‘gpg-card’:

     gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9C &lt; sign.crt

   By running list again we will see the fully initialized card:

   It is now possible to sign and to encrypt with this card using gpgsm
and to use the ‘PIV authentication’ key with ssh:

     $ ssh-add -l
     384 SHA256:0qnJ0Y0ehWxKcx2frLfEljf6GCdlO55OZed5HqGHsaU cardno:yk-9074625 (ECDSA)

   As usual use ssh-add with the uppercase ‘-L’ to list the public ssh
key.  To use the certificates with Thunderbird or Mozilla, please
consult the Scute manual for details.

   If you want to use the same PIV keys also for OpenPGP (for example on
a Yubikey to avoid switching between OpenPGP and PIV), this is also
possible:

10.1 Read logs from a socket
============================

Most of the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix
Domain socket if configured that way.  ‘watchgnupg’ is a simple listener
for such a socket.  It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and
makes sure that long lines are not interspersed with log output from
other utilities.  This tool is not available for Windows.

‘watchgnupg’ is commonly invoked as

     watchgnupg

   which is a shorthand for

     watchgnupg --force $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log

   To watch GnuPG running with a different home directory, use

     watchgnupg --homedir DIR

This starts it on the current terminal for listening on the standard
logging socket (this is commonly ‘/var/run/user/UID/gnupg/S.log’ or if
no such user directory hierarchy exists ‘~/.gnupg/S.log’).

‘watchgnupg’ understands these options:

‘--force’
     Delete an already existing socket file.  This option is implicitly
     used if no socket name has been given on the command line.

‘--homedir DIR’
     If no socket name is given on the command line, pass DIR to gpgconf
     so that the socket for a GnuPG running with DIR has its home
     directory is used.  Note that the environment variable GNUPGHOME is
     ignored by watchgnupg.

‘--tcp N’
     Instead of reading from a local socket, listen for connects on TCP
     port N.  A Unix domain socket can optionally also be given as a
     second source.  This option does not use a default socket name.

‘--time-only’
     Do not print the date part of the timestamp.

‘--verbose’
     Enable extra informational output.

‘--version’
     Print version of the program and exit.

‘--help’
     Display a brief help page and exit.

Examples
********

     $ watchgnupg --time-only

   This waits for connections on the local socket (e.g.
‘/var/run/user/1234/gnupg/S.log’) and shows all log entries.  To make
this work the option ‘log-file’ needs to be used with all modules which
logs are to be shown.  The suggested entry for the configuration files
is:

     log-file socket://

   If the default socket as given above and returned by &quot;echo $(gpgconf
-list-dirs socketdir)/S.log&quot; is not desired an arbitrary socket name can
be specified, for example ‘socket:///home/foo/bar/mysocket’.  For
debugging purposes it is also possible to do remote logging.  Take care
if you use this feature because the information is send in the clear
over the network.  Use this syntax in the conf files:

     log-file tcp://192.168.1.1:4711

   You may use any port and not just 4711 as shown above; only IP
addresses are supported (v4 and v6) and no host names.  You need to
start ‘watchgnupg’ with the ‘tcp’ option.  Note that under Windows the
registry entry HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:DEFAULTLOGFILE can be used to
change the default log output from ‘stderr’ to whatever is given by that
entry.  However the only useful entry is a TCP name for remote
debugging.

10.2 Verify OpenPGP signatures
==============================

‘gpgv’ is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

   This program is actually a stripped-down version of ‘gpg’ which is
only able to check signatures.  It is somewhat smaller than the
fully-blown ‘gpg’ and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that
the public keys used to make the signature are valid.  There are no
configuration files and only a few options are implemented.

   ‘gpgv’ assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  That
does also mean that it does not check for expired or revoked keys.

   If no ‘--keyring’ option is given, ‘gpgv’ looks for a &quot;default&quot;
keyring named ‘trustedkeys.kbx’ (preferred) or ‘trustedkeys.gpg’ in the
home directory of GnuPG, either the default home directory or the one
set by the ‘--homedir’ option or the ‘GNUPGHOME’ environment variable.
If any ‘--keyring’ option is used, ‘gpgv’ will not look for the default
keyring.  The ‘--keyring’ option may be used multiple times and all
specified keyrings will be used together.

   ‘gpgv’ recognizes these options:

‘--verbose’
‘-v’
     Gives more information during processing.  If used twice, the input
     data is listed in detail.

‘--quiet’
‘-q’
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

‘--keyring FILE’
     Add FILE to the list of keyrings.  If FILE begins with a tilde and
     a slash, these are replaced by the HOME directory.  If the filename
     does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the home-directory
     (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if -homedir is not used).

‘--output FILE’
‘-o FILE’
     Write output to FILE; to write to stdout use ‘-’.  This option can
     be used to get the signed text from a cleartext or binary
     signature; it also works for detached signatures, but in that case
     this option is in general not useful.  Note that an existing file
     will be overwritten.

‘--status-fd N’
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  See the
     file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

‘--logger-fd n’
     Write log output to file descriptor ‘n’ and not to stderr.

‘--log-file file’
     Same as ‘--logger-fd’, except the logger data is written to file
     ‘file’.  Use ‘socket://’ to log to socket.

‘--ignore-time-conflict’
     GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
     signatures have plausible values.  However, sometimes a signature
     seems to be older than the key due to clock problems.  This option
     turns these checks into warnings.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘--weak-digest name’
     Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.  Signatures made over
     weak digests algorithms are normally rejected.  This option can be
     supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be considered
     weak.  MD5 is always considered weak, and does not need to be
     listed explicitly.

‘--enable-special-filenames’
     This option enables a mode in which filenames of the form ‘-&amp;n’,
     where n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the file
     descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

‘--assert-pubkey-algo ALGOLIST’
     This option works in the same way as described for ‘gpg’.

   The program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least one
signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

10.2.1 Examples
---------------

gpgv ‘pgpfile’
gpgv ‘sigfile’ [‘datafile’]
     Verify the signature of the file.  The second form is used for
     detached signatures, where ‘sigfile’ is the detached signature
     (either ASCII-armored or binary) and ‘datafile’ contains the signed
     data; if ‘datafile’ is &quot;-&quot; the signed data is expected on ‘stdin’;
     if ‘datafile’ is not given the name of the file holding the signed
     data is constructed by cutting off the extension (&quot;.asc&quot;, &quot;.sig&quot; or
     &quot;.sign&quot;) from ‘sigfile’.

10.2.2 Environment
------------------

HOME
     Used to locate the default home directory.

GNUPGHOME
     If set directory used instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.

10.2.3 FILES
------------

~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
     The default keyring with the allowed keys.

   ‘gpg’(1)

File: gnupg.info,  Node: addgnupghome,  Next: gpgconf,  Prev: gpgv,  Up: Helper Tools

10.3 Create .gnupg home directories
===================================

If GnuPG is installed on a system with existing user accounts, it is
sometimes required to populate the GnuPG home directory with existing
files.  Especially a ‘trustlist.txt’ and a keybox with some initial
certificates are often desired.  This script helps to do this by copying
all files from ‘/etc/skel/.gnupg’ to the home directories of the
accounts given on the command line.  It takes care not to overwrite
existing GnuPG home directories.

‘addgnupghome’ is invoked by root as:

     addgnupghome account1 account2 ... accountn

File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpgconf,  Next: applygnupgdefaults,  Prev: addgnupghome,  Up: Helper Tools

10.4 Modify .gnupg home directories
===================================

The ‘gpgconf’ is a utility to automatically and reasonable safely query
and modify configuration files in the ‘.gnupg’ home directory.  It is
designed not to be invoked manually by the user, but automatically by
graphical user interfaces (GUI).(1)

   ‘gpgconf’ provides access to the configuration of one or more
components of the GnuPG system.  These components correspond more or
less to the programs that exist in the GnuPG framework, like GPG, GPGSM,
DirMngr, etc.  But this is not a strict one-to-one relationship.  Not
all configuration options are available through ‘gpgconf’.  ‘gpgconf’
provides a generic and abstract method to access the most important
configuration options that can feasibly be controlled via such a
mechanism.

   ‘gpgconf’ can be used to gather and change the options available in
each component, and can also provide their default values.  ‘gpgconf’
will give detailed type information that can be used to restrict the
user&#39;s input without making an attempt to commit the changes.

   ‘gpgconf’ provides the backend of a configuration editor.  The
configuration editor would usually be a graphical user interface program
that displays the current options, their default values, and allows the
user to make changes to the options.  These changes can then be made
active with ‘gpgconf’ again.  Such a program that uses ‘gpgconf’ in this
way will be called GUI throughout this section.

   (1) Please note that currently no locking is done, so concurrent
access should be avoided.  There are some precautions to avoid
corruption with concurrent usage, but results may be inconsistent and
some changes may get lost.  The stateless design makes it difficult to
provide more guarantees.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking gpgconf,  Next: Format conventions,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.1 Invoking gpgconf
-----------------------

One of the following commands must be given:

‘--list-components’
     List all components.  This is the default command used if none is
     specified.

‘--check-programs’
     List all available backend programs and test whether they are
     runnable.

‘--list-options COMPONENT’
     List all options of the component COMPONENT.

‘--change-options COMPONENT’
     Change the options of the component COMPONENT.

‘--check-options COMPONENT’
     Check the options for the component COMPONENT.

‘--apply-profile FILE’
     Apply the configuration settings listed in FILE to the
     configuration files.  If FILE has no suffix and no slashes the
     command first tries to read a file with the suffix ‘.prf’ from the
     data directory (‘gpgconf --list-dirs datadir’) before it reads the
     file verbatim.  A profile is divided into sections using the
     bracketed component name.  Each section then lists the option which
     shall go into the respective configuration file.

‘--apply-defaults’
     Update all configuration files with values taken from the global
     configuration file (usually ‘/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf’).  Note: This
     is a legacy mechanism.  Please use global configuration files
     instead.

‘--list-dirs [NAMES]’
‘-L’
     Lists the directories used by ‘gpgconf’.  One directory is listed
     per line, and each line consists of a colon-separated list where
     the first field names the directory type (for example ‘sysconfdir’)
     and the second field contains the percent-escaped directory.
     Although they are not directories, the socket file names used by
     ‘gpg-agent’ and ‘dirmngr’ are printed as well.  Note that the
     socket file names and the ‘homedir’ lines are the default names and
     they may be overridden by command line switches.  If NAMES are
     given only the directories or file names specified by the list
     names are printed without any escaping.

‘--list-config [FILENAME]’
     List the global configuration file in a colon separated format.  If
     FILENAME is given, check that file instead.

‘--check-config [FILENAME]’
     Run a syntax check on the global configuration file.  If FILENAME
     is given, check that file instead.

‘--query-swdb PACKAGE_NAME [VERSION_STRING]’
     Returns the current version for PACKAGE_NAME and if VERSION_STRING
     is given also an indicator on whether an update is available.  The
     actual file with the software version is automatically downloaded
     and checked by ‘dirmngr’.  ‘dirmngr’ uses a thresholds to avoid
     download the file too often and it does this by default only if it
     can be done via Tor.  To force an update of that file this command
     can be used:

                 gpg-connect-agent --dirmngr &#39;loadswdb --force&#39; /bye

‘--reload [COMPONENT]’
‘-R’
     Reload all or the given component.  This is basically the same as
     sending a SIGHUP to the component.  Components which don&#39;t support
     reloading are ignored.  Without COMPONENT or by using &quot;all&quot; for
     COMPONENT all components which are daemons are reloaded.

‘--launch [COMPONENT]’
     If the COMPONENT is not already running, start it.  ‘component’
     must be a daemon.  This is in general not required because the
     system starts these daemons as needed.  However, external software
     making direct use of ‘gpg-agent’ or ‘dirmngr’ may use this command
     to ensure that they are started.  Using &quot;all&quot; for COMPONENT
     launches all components which are daemons.

‘--kill [COMPONENT]’
‘-K’
     Kill the given component that runs as a daemon, including
     ‘gpg-agent’, ‘dirmngr’, and ‘scdaemon’.  A ‘component’ which does
     not run as a daemon will be ignored.  Using &quot;all&quot; for COMPONENT
     kills all components running as daemons.  Note that as of now
     reload and kill have the same effect for ‘scdaemon’.

‘--create-socketdir’
     Create a directory for sockets below /run/user or /var/run/user.
     This is command is only required if a non default home directory is
     used and the /run based sockets shall be used.  For the default
     home directory GnuPG creates a directory on the fly.

‘--remove-socketdir’
     Remove a directory created with command ‘--create-socketdir’.

‘--unlock NAME’
‘--lock NAME’
     Remove a stale lock file hold for ‘file’.  The file is expected in
     the current GnuPG home directory.  This command is usually not
     required because GnuPG is able to detect and remove stale lock
     files.  Before using the command make sure that the file protected
     by the lock file is actually not in use.  The lock command may be
     used to lock an accidentally removed lock file.  Note that the
     commands have no effect on Windows because the mere existence of a
     lock file does not mean that the lock is active.

   The following options may be used:

‘-o FILE’
‘--output FILE’
     Write output to FILE.  Default is to write to stdout.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Outputs additional information while running.  Specifically, this
     extends numerical field values by human-readable descriptions.

‘-q’
‘--quiet’
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘--chuid UID’
     Change the current user to UID which may either be a number or a
     name.  This can be used from the root account to get information on
     the GnuPG environment of the specified user or to start or kill
     daemons.  If UID is not the current UID a standard PATH is set and
     the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the option
     ‘--homedir’ can be used.  This option has currently no effect on
     Windows.

‘-n’
‘--dry-run’
     Do not actually change anything.  This is currently only
     implemented for ‘--change-options’ and can be used for testing
     purposes.

‘-r’
‘--runtime’
     Only used together with ‘--change-options’.  If one of the modified
     options can be changed in a running daemon process, signal the
     running daemon to ask it to reparse its configuration file after
     changing.

     This means that the changes will take effect at run-time, as far as
     this is possible.  Otherwise, they will take effect at the next
     start of the respective backend programs.

‘--status-fd N’
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  This
     program returns the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which are
     helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can&#39;t
     easily get the return code of the process.

10.4.2 Format conventions
-------------------------

Some lines in the output of ‘gpgconf’ contain a list of colon-separated
fields.  The following conventions apply:

   • The GUI program is required to strip off trailing newline and/or
     carriage return characters from the output.

   • ‘gpgconf’ will never leave out fields.  If a certain version
     provides a certain field, this field will always be present in all
     ‘gpgconf’ versions from that time on.

   • Future versions of ‘gpgconf’ might append fields to the list.  New
     fields will always be separated from the previously last field by a
     colon separator.  The GUI should be prepared to parse the last
     field it knows about up until a colon or end of line.

   • Not all fields are defined under all conditions.  You are required
     to ignore the content of undefined fields.

   There are several standard types for the content of a field:

verbatim
     Some fields contain strings that are not escaped in any way.  Such
     fields are described to be used _verbatim_.  These fields will
     never contain a colon character (for obvious reasons).  No
     de-escaping or other formatting is required to use the field
     content.  This is for easy parsing of the output, when it is known
     that the content can never contain any special characters.

percent-escaped
     Some fields contain strings that are described to be
     _percent-escaped_.  Such strings need to be de-escaped before their
     content can be presented to the user.  A percent-escaped string is
     de-escaped by replacing all occurrences of ‘%XY’ by the byte that
     has the hexadecimal value ‘XY’.  ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are from the set
     ‘0-9a-f’.

localized
     Some fields contain strings that are described to be _localized_.
     Such strings are translated to the active language and formatted in
     the active character set.

unsigned number
     Some fields contain an _unsigned number_.  This number will always
     fit into a 32-bit unsigned integer variable.  The number may be
     followed by a space, followed by a human readable description of
     that value (if the verbose option is used).  You should ignore
     everything in the field that follows the number.

signed number
     Some fields contain a _signed number_.  This number will always fit
     into a 32-bit signed integer variable.  The number may be followed
     by a space, followed by a human readable description of that value
     (if the verbose option is used).  You should ignore everything in
     the field that follows the number.

boolean value
     Some fields contain a _boolean value_.  This is a number with
     either the value 0 or 1.  The number may be followed by a space,
     followed by a human readable description of that value (if the
     verbose option is used).  You should ignore everything in the field
     that follows the number; checking just the first character is
     sufficient in this case.

option
     Some fields contain an _option_ argument.  The format of an option
     argument depends on the type of the option and on some flags:

     no argument
          The simplest case is that the option does not take an argument
          at all (TYPE ‘0’).  Then the option argument is an unsigned
          number that specifies how often the option occurs.  If the
          ‘list’ flag is not set, then the only valid number is ‘1’.
          Options that do not take an argument never have the ‘default’
          or ‘optional arg’ flag set.

     number
          If the option takes a number argument (ALT-TYPE is ‘2’ or
          ‘3’), and it can only occur once (‘list’ flag is not set),
          then the option argument is either empty (only allowed if the
          argument is optional), or it is a number.  A number is a
          string that begins with an optional minus character, followed
          by one or more digits.  The number must fit into an integer
          variable (unsigned or signed, depending on ALT-TYPE).

     number list
          If the option takes a number argument and it can occur more
          than once, then the option argument is either empty, or it is
          a comma-separated list of numbers as described above.

     string
          If the option takes a string argument (ALT-TYPE is 1), and it
          can only occur once (‘list’ flag is not set) then the option
          argument is either empty (only allowed if the argument is
          optional), or it starts with a double quote character (‘&quot;’)
          followed by a percent-escaped string that is the argument
          value.  Note that there is only a leading double quote
          character, no trailing one.  The double quote character is
          only needed to be able to differentiate between no value and
          the empty string as value.

     string list
          If the option takes a string argument and it can occur more
          than once, then the option argument is either empty, or it is
          a comma-separated list of string arguments as described above.

   The active language and character set are currently determined from
the locale environment of the ‘gpgconf’ program.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Listing components,  Next: Checking programs,  Prev: Format conventions,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.3 Listing components
-------------------------

The command ‘--list-components’ will list all components that can be
configured with ‘gpgconf’.  Usually, one component will correspond to
one GnuPG-related program and contain the options of that program&#39;s
configuration file that can be modified using ‘gpgconf’.  However, this
is not necessarily the case.  A component might also be a group of
selected options from several programs, or contain entirely virtual
options that have a special effect rather than changing exactly one
option in one configuration file.

   A component is a set of configuration options that semantically
belong together.  Furthermore, several changes to a component can be
made in an atomic way with a single operation.  The GUI could for
example provide a menu with one entry for each component, or a window
with one tabulator sheet per component.

   The command ‘--list-components’ lists all available components, one
per line.  The format of each line is:

   ‘NAME:DESCRIPTION:PGMNAME:’

NAME
     This field contains a name tag of the component.  The name tag is
     used to specify the component in all communication with ‘gpgconf’.
     The name tag is to be used _verbatim_.  It is thus not in any
     escaped format.

DESCRIPTION
     The _string_ in this field contains a human-readable description of
     the component.  It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for
     informational purposes.  It is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

PGMNAME
     The _string_ in this field contains the absolute name of the
     program&#39;s file.  It can be used to unambiguously invoke that
     program.  It is _percent-escaped_.

   Example:
     $ gpgconf --list-components
     gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:
     gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:
     scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:
     gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:
     dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Checking programs,  Next: Listing options,  Prev: Listing components,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.4 Checking programs
------------------------

The command ‘--check-programs’ is similar to ‘--list-components’ but
works on backend programs and not on components.  It runs each program
to test whether it is installed and runnable.  This also includes a
syntax check of all config file options of the program.

   The command ‘--check-programs’ lists all available programs, one per
line.  The format of each line is:

   ‘NAME:DESCRIPTION:PGMNAME:AVAIL:OKAY:CFGFILE:LINE:ERROR:’

NAME
     This field contains a name tag of the program which is identical to
     the name of the component.  The name tag is to be used _verbatim_.
     It is thus not in any escaped format.  This field may be empty to
     indicate a continuation of error descriptions for the last name.
     The description and pgmname fields are then also empty.

DESCRIPTION
     The _string_ in this field contains a human-readable description of
     the component.  It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for
     informational purposes.  It is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

PGMNAME
     The _string_ in this field contains the absolute name of the
     program&#39;s file.  It can be used to unambiguously invoke that
     program.  It is _percent-escaped_.

AVAIL
     The _boolean value_ in this field indicates whether the program is
     installed and runnable.

OKAY
     The _boolean value_ in this field indicates whether the program&#39;s
     config file is syntactically okay.

CFGFILE
     If an error occurred in the configuration file (as indicated by a
     false value in the field ‘okay’), this field has the name of the
     failing configuration file.  It is _percent-escaped_.

LINE
     If an error occurred in the configuration file, this field has the
     line number of the failing statement in the configuration file.  It
     is an _unsigned number_.

ERROR
     If an error occurred in the configuration file, this field has the
     error text of the failing statement in the configuration file.  It
     is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

In the following example the ‘dirmngr’ is not runnable and the
configuration file of ‘scdaemon’ is not okay.

     $ gpgconf --check-programs
     gpg:GPG for OpenPGP:/usr/local/bin/gpg2:1:1:
     gpg-agent:GPG Agent:/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent:1:1:
     scdaemon:Smartcard Daemon:/usr/local/bin/scdaemon:1:0:
     gpgsm:GPG for S/MIME:/usr/local/bin/gpgsm:1:1:
     dirmngr:Directory Manager:/usr/local/bin/dirmngr:0:0:

The command ‘--check-options COMPONENT’ will verify the configuration
file in the same manner as ‘--check-programs’, but only for the
component COMPONENT.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Listing options,  Next: Changing options,  Prev: Checking programs,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.5 Listing options
----------------------

Every component contains one or more options.  Options may be gathered
into option groups to allow the GUI to give visual hints to the user
about which options are related.

   The command ‘--list-options COMPONENT’ lists all options (and the
groups they belong to) in the component COMPONENT, one per line.
COMPONENT must be the string in the field NAME in the output of the
‘--list-components’ command.

   There is one line for each option and each group.  First come all
options that are not in any group.  Then comes a line describing a
group.  Then come all options that belong into each group.  Then comes
the next group and so on.  There does not need to be any group (and in
this case the output will stop after the last non-grouped option).

   The format of each line is:

   ‘NAME:FLAGS:LEVEL:DESCRIPTION:TYPE:ALT-TYPE:ARGNAME:DEFAULT:ARGDEF:VALUE’

NAME
     This field contains a name tag for the group or option.  The name
     tag is used to specify the group or option in all communication
     with ‘gpgconf’.  The name tag is to be used _verbatim_.  It is thus
     not in any escaped format.

FLAGS
     The flags field contains an _unsigned number_.  Its value is the
     OR-wise combination of the following flag values:

     ‘group (1)’
          If this flag is set, this is a line describing a group and not
          an option.

     The following flag values are only defined for options (that is, if
     the ‘group’ flag is not used).

     ‘optional arg (2)’
          If this flag is set, the argument is optional.  This is never
          set for TYPE ‘0’ (none) options.

     ‘list (4)’
          If this flag is set, the option can be given multiple times.

     ‘runtime (8)’
          If this flag is set, the option can be changed at runtime.

     ‘default (16)’
          If this flag is set, a default value is available.

     ‘default desc (32)’
          If this flag is set, a (runtime) default is available.  This
          and the ‘default’ flag are mutually exclusive.

     ‘no arg desc (64)’
          If this flag is set, and the ‘optional arg’ flag is set, then
          the option has a special meaning if no argument is given.

     ‘no change (128)’
          If this flag is set, ‘gpgconf’ ignores requests to change the
          value.  GUI frontends should grey out this option.  Note, that
          manual changes of the configuration files are still possible.

LEVEL
     This field is defined for options and for groups.  It contains an
     _unsigned number_ that specifies the expert level under which this
     group or option should be displayed.  The following expert levels
     are defined for options (they have analogous meaning for groups):

     ‘basic (0)’
          This option should always be offered to the user.

     ‘advanced (1)’
          This option may be offered to advanced users.

     ‘expert (2)’
          This option should only be offered to expert users.

     ‘invisible (3)’
          This option should normally never be displayed, not even to
          expert users.

     ‘internal (4)’
          This option is for internal use only.  Ignore it.

     The level of a group will always be the lowest level of all options
     it contains.

DESCRIPTION
     This field is defined for options and groups.  The _string_ in this
     field contains a human-readable description of the option or group.
     It can be displayed to the user of the GUI for informational
     purposes.  It is _percent-escaped_ and _localized_.

TYPE
     This field is only defined for options.  It contains an _unsigned
     number_ that specifies the type of the option&#39;s argument, if any.
     The following types are defined:

     Basic types:

     ‘none (0)’
          No argument allowed.

     ‘string (1)’
          An _unformatted string_.

     ‘int32 (2)’
          A _signed number_.

     ‘uint32 (3)’
          An _unsigned number_.

     Complex types:

     ‘pathname (32)’
          A _string_ that describes the pathname of a file.  The file
          does not necessarily need to exist.

     ‘ldap server (33)’
          A _string_ that describes an LDAP server in the format:

          ‘HOSTNAME:PORT:USERNAME:PASSWORD:BASE_DN’

     ‘key fingerprint (34)’
          A _string_ with a 40 digit fingerprint specifying a
          certificate.

     ‘pub key (35)’
          A _string_ that describes a certificate by user ID, key ID or
          fingerprint.

     ‘sec key (36)’
          A _string_ that describes a certificate with a key by user ID,
          key ID or fingerprint.

     ‘alias list (37)’
          A _string_ that describes an alias list, like the one used
          with gpg&#39;s group option.  The list consists of a key, an equal
          sign and space separated values.

     More types will be added in the future.  Please see the ALT-TYPE
     field for information on how to cope with unknown types.

ALT-TYPE
     This field is identical to TYPE, except that only the types ‘0’ to
     ‘31’ are allowed.  The GUI is expected to present the user the
     option in the format specified by TYPE.  But if the argument type
     TYPE is not supported by the GUI, it can still display the option
     in the more generic basic type ALT-TYPE.  The GUI must support all
     the defined basic types to be able to display all options.  More
     basic types may be added in future versions.  If the GUI encounters
     a basic type it doesn&#39;t support, it should report an error and
     abort the operation.

ARGNAME
     This field is only defined for options with an argument type TYPE
     that is not ‘0’.  In this case it may contain a _percent-escaped_
     and _localized string_ that gives a short name for the argument.
     The field may also be empty, though, in which case a short name is
     not known.

DEFAULT
     This field is defined only for options for which the ‘default’ or
     ‘default desc’ flag is set.  If the ‘default’ flag is set, its
     format is that of an _option argument_ (*note Format conventions::,
     for details).  If the default value is empty, then no default is
     known.  Otherwise, the value specifies the default value for this
     option.  If the ‘default desc’ flag is set, the field is either
     empty or contains a description of the effect if the option is not
     given.

ARGDEF
     This field is defined only for options for which the ‘optional arg’
     flag is set.  If the ‘no arg desc’ flag is not set, its format is
     that of an _option argument_ (*note Format conventions::, for
     details).  If the default value is empty, then no default is known.
     Otherwise, the value specifies the default argument for this
     option.  If the ‘no arg desc’ flag is set, the field is either
     empty or contains a description of the effect of this option if no
     argument is given.

VALUE
     This field is defined only for options.  Its format is that of an
     _option argument_.  If it is empty, then the option is not
     explicitly set in the current configuration, and the default
     applies (if any).  Otherwise, it contains the current value of the
     option.  Note that this field is also meaningful if the option
     itself does not take a real argument (in this case, it contains the
     number of times the option appears).

10.4.6 Changing options
-----------------------

The command ‘--change-options COMPONENT’ will attempt to change the
options of the component COMPONENT to the specified values.  COMPONENT
must be the string in the field NAME in the output of the
‘--list-components’ command.  You have to provide the options that shall
be changed in the following format on standard input:

   ‘NAME:FLAGS:NEW-VALUE’

NAME
     This is the name of the option to change.  NAME must be the string
     in the field NAME in the output of the ‘--list-options’ command.

FLAGS
     The flags field contains an _unsigned number_.  Its value is the
     OR-wise combination of the following flag values:

     ‘default (16)’
          If this flag is set, the option is deleted and the default
          value is used instead (if applicable).

NEW-VALUE
     The new value for the option.  This field is only defined if the
     ‘default’ flag is not set.  The format is that of an _option
     argument_.  If it is empty (or the field is omitted), the default
     argument is used (only allowed if the argument is optional for this
     option).  Otherwise, the option will be set to the specified value.

The output of the command is the same as that of ‘--check-options’ for
the modified configuration file.

   Examples:

   To set the force option, which is of basic type ‘none (0)’:

     $ echo &#39;force:0:1&#39; | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr

   To delete the force option:

     $ echo &#39;force:16:&#39; | gpgconf --change-options dirmngr

   The ‘--runtime’ option can influence when the changes take effect.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Listing global options,  Next: Querying versions,  Prev: Changing options,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.7 Listing global options
-----------------------------

Some legacy applications look at the global configuration file for the
gpgconf tool itself; this is the file ‘gpgconf.conf’.  Modern
applications should not use it but use per component global
configuration files which are more flexible than the ‘gpgconf.conf’.
Using both files is not suggested.

   The colon separated listing format is record oriented and uses the
first field to identify the record type:

‘k’
     This describes a key record to start the definition of a new
     ruleset for a user/group.  The format of a key record is:

     ‘k:USER:GROUP:’

     USER
          This is the user field of the key.  It is percent escaped.
          See the definition of the gpgconf.conf format for details.

     GROUP
          This is the group field of the key.  It is percent escaped.

‘r’
     This describes a rule record.  All rule records up to the next key
     record make up a rule set for that key.  The format of a rule
     record is:

     ‘r:::COMPONENT:OPTION:FLAG:VALUE:’

     COMPONENT
          This is the component part of a rule.  It is a plain string.

     OPTION
          This is the option part of a rule.  It is a plain string.

     FLAG
          This is the flags part of a rule.  There may be only one flag
          per rule but by using the same component and option, several
          flags may be assigned to an option.  It is a plain string.

     VALUE
          This is the optional value for the option.  It is a percent
          escaped string with a single quotation mark to indicate a
          string.  The quotation mark is only required to distinguish
          between no value specified and an empty string.

Unknown record types should be ignored.  Note that there is
intentionally no feature to change the global option file through
‘gpgconf’.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Querying versions,  Next: Files used by gpgconf,  Prev: Listing global options,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.8 Get and compare software versions.
-----------------------------------------

The GnuPG Project operates a server to query the current versions of
software packages related to GnuPG. ‘gpgconf’ can be used to access this
online database.  To allow for offline operations, this feature works by
having ‘dirmngr’ download a file from ‘https://versions.gnupg.org’,
checking the signature of that file and storing the file in the GnuPG
home directory.  If ‘gpgconf’ is used and ‘dirmngr’ is running, it may
ask ‘dirmngr’ to refresh that file before itself uses the file.

   The command ‘--query-swdb’ returns information for the given package
in a colon delimited format:

NAME
     This is the name of the package as requested.  Note that &quot;gnupg&quot; is
     a special name which is replaced by the actual package implementing
     this version of GnuPG. For this name it is also not required to
     specify a version because ‘gpgconf’ takes its own version in this
     case.

IVERSION
     The currently installed version or an empty string.  The value is
     taken from the command line argument but may be provided by gpg if
     not given.

STATUS
     The status of the software package according to this table:
     ‘-’
          No information available.  This is either because no current
          version has been specified or due to an error.
     ‘?’
          The given name is not known in the online database.
     ‘u’
          An update of the software is available.
     ‘c’
          The installed version of the software is current.
     ‘n’
          The installed version is already newer than the released
          version.

URGENCY
     If the value (the empty string should be considered as zero) is
     greater than zero an important update is available.

ERROR
     This returns an ‘gpg-error’ error code to distinguish between
     various failure modes.

FILEDATE
     This gives the date of the file with the version numbers in
     standard ISO format (‘yyyymmddThhmmss’).  The date has been
     extracted by ‘dirmngr’ from the signature of the file.

VERIFIED
     This gives the date in ISO format the file was downloaded.  This
     value can be used to evaluate the freshness of the information.

VERSION
     This returns the version string for the requested software from the
     file.

RELDATE
     This returns the release date in ISO format.

SIZE
     This returns the size of the package as decimal number of bytes.

HASH
     This returns a hexified SHA-2 hash of the package.

More fields may be added in future to the output.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Files used by gpgconf,  Prev: Querying versions,  Up: gpgconf

10.4.9 Files used by gpgconf
----------------------------

‘gpgconf.ctl’
     Under Unix ‘gpgconf.ctl’ may be used to change some of the compiled
     in directories where the GnuPG components are expected.  This file
     is expected in the same directory as ‘gpgconf’.  The physical
     installation directories are evaluated and no symlinks.  Blank
     lines and lines starting with pound sign are ignored in the file.
     The keywords must be followed by optional white space, an equal
     sign, optional white space, and the value.  Environment variables
     are substituted in standard shell manner, the final value must
     start with a slash, trailing slashes are stripped.  Valid keywords
     are ‘rootdir’, ‘sysconfdir’, ‘socketdir’, and ‘.enable’.  No errors
     are printed for unknown keywords.  The ‘.enable’ keyword is
     special: if the keyword is used and its value evaluates to true the
     entire file is ignored.

     Under Windows this file is used to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  An empty file named ‘gpgconf.ctl’ is expected in the
     same directory as the tool ‘gpgconf.exe’.  The root of the
     installation is then that directory; or, if ‘gpgconf.exe’ has been
     installed directly below a directory named ‘bin’, its parent
     directory.  You also need to make sure that the following
     directories exist and are writable: ‘ROOT/home’ for the GnuPG home
     and ‘ROOT/var/cache/gnupg’ for internal cache files.

‘/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf’
     If this file exists, it is processed as a global configuration
     file.  This is a legacy mechanism which should not be used together
     with the modern global per component configuration files.  A
     commented example can be found in the ‘examples’ directory of the
     distribution.

‘GNUPGHOME/swdb.lst’
     A file with current software versions.  ‘dirmngr’ creates this file
     on demand from an online resource.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: applygnupgdefaults,  Next: gpg-preset-passphrase,  Prev: gpgconf,  Up: Helper Tools

10.5 Run gpgconf for all users
==============================

This is a legacy script.  Modern application should use the per
component global configuration files under ‘/etc/gnupg/’.

   This script is a wrapper around ‘gpgconf’ to run it with the command
‘--apply-defaults’ for all real users with an existing GnuPG home
directory.  Admins might want to use this script to update he GnuPG
configuration files for all users after ‘/etc/gnupg/gpgconf.conf’ has
been changed.  This allows enforcing certain policies for all users.
Note, that this is not a bulletproof way to force a user to use certain
options.  A user may always directly edit the configuration files and
bypass gpgconf.

‘applygnupgdefaults’ is invoked by root as:

     applygnupgdefaults

10.6 Put a passphrase into the cache
====================================

The ‘gpg-preset-passphrase’ is a utility to seed the internal cache of a
running ‘gpg-agent’ with passphrases.  It is mainly useful for
unattended machines, where the usual ‘pinentry’ tool may not be used and
the passphrases for the to be used keys are given at machine startup.

   This program works with GnuPG 2 and later.  GnuPG 1.x is not
supported.

   Passphrases set with this utility don&#39;t expire unless the ‘--forget’
option is used to explicitly clear them from the cache -- or ‘gpg-agent’
is either restarted or reloaded (by sending a SIGHUP to it).  Note that
the maximum cache time as set with ‘--max-cache-ttl’ is still honored.
It is necessary to allow this passphrase presetting by starting
‘gpg-agent’ with the ‘--allow-preset-passphrase’.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking gpg-preset-passphrase,  Up: gpg-preset-passphrase

10.6.1 List of all commands and options
---------------------------------------

‘gpg-preset-passphrase’ is invoked this way:

     gpg-preset-passphrase [options] [command] CACHEID

   CACHEID is either a 40 character keygrip of hexadecimal characters
identifying the key for which the passphrase should be set or cleared.
The keygrip is listed along with the key when running the command:
‘gpgsm --with-keygrip --list-secret-keys’.  Alternatively an arbitrary
string may be used to identify a passphrase; it is suggested that such a
string is prefixed with the name of the application (e.g ‘foo:12346’).
Scripts should always use the option ‘--with-colons’, which provides the
keygrip in a &quot;grp&quot; line (cf.  ‘doc/DETAILS’)/

One of the following command options must be given:

‘--preset’
     Preset a passphrase.  This is what you usually will use.
     ‘gpg-preset-passphrase’ will then read the passphrase from ‘stdin’.

‘--forget’
     Flush the passphrase for the given cache ID from the cache.

The following additional options may be used:

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Output additional information while running.

‘-P STRING’
‘--passphrase STRING’
     Instead of reading the passphrase from ‘stdin’, use the supplied
     STRING as passphrase.  Note that this makes the passphrase visible
     for other users.

10.7 Communicate with a running agent
=====================================

The ‘gpg-connect-agent’ is a utility to communicate with a running
‘gpg-agent’.  It is useful to check out the commands ‘gpg-agent’
provides using the Assuan interface.  It might also be useful for
scripting simple applications.  Input is expected at stdin and output
gets printed to stdout.

   It is very similar to running ‘gpg-agent’ in server mode; but here we
connect to a running instance.

* Invoking gpg-connect-agent::       List of all options.
* Controlling gpg-connect-agent::    Control commands.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Invoking gpg-connect-agent,  Next: Controlling gpg-connect-agent,  Up: gpg-connect-agent

10.7.1 List of all options
--------------------------

‘gpg-connect-agent’ is invoked this way:

     gpg-connect-agent [options] [commands]

The following options may be used:

‘--dirmngr’
     Connect to a running directory manager (keyserver client) instead
     of to the gpg-agent.  If a dirmngr is not running, start it.

‘--keyboxd’
     Connect to a running keybox daemon instead of to the gpg-agent.  If
     a keyboxd is not running, start it.

‘-S’
‘--raw-socket NAME’
     Connect to socket NAME assuming this is an Assuan style server.  Do
     not run any special initializations or environment checks.  This
     may be used to directly connect to any Assuan style socket server.

‘-E’
‘--exec’
     Take the rest of the command line as a program and it&#39;s arguments
     and execute it as an Assuan server.  Here is how you would run
     ‘gpgsm’:
           gpg-connect-agent --exec gpgsm --server
     Note that you may not use options on the command line in this case.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Output additional information while running.

‘-q’
‘--quiet’
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

‘--homedir DIR’
     Set the name of the home directory to DIR.  If this option is not
     used, the home directory defaults to ‘~/.gnupg’.  It is only
     recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any
     home directory stated through the environment variable ‘GNUPGHOME’
     or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
     HKCU\SOFTWARE\GNU\GNUPG:HOMEDIR.

     On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
     application.  In this case only this command line option is
     considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

‘--chuid UID’
     Change the current user to UID which may either be a number or a
     name.  This can be used from the root account to run
     gpg-connect-agent for another user.  If UID is not the current UID
     a standard PATH is set and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To
     override the latter the option ‘--homedir’ can be used.  This
     option has only an effect when used on the command line.  This
     option has currently no effect at all on Windows.

‘--no-ext-connect’
     When using ‘-S’ or ‘--exec’, ‘gpg-connect-agent’ connects to the
     Assuan server in extended mode to allow descriptor passing.  This
     option makes it use the old mode.

‘--no-autostart’
     Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not yet been
     started.

‘--no-history’
     In interactive mode the command line history is usually saved and
     restored to and from a file below the GnuPG home directory.  This
     option inhibits the use of that file.

‘--agent-program FILE’
     Specify the agent program to be started if none is running.  The
     default value is determined by running ‘gpgconf’ with the option
     ‘--list-dirs’.  Note that the pipe symbol (‘|’) is used for a
     regression test suite hack and may thus not be used in the file
     name.

‘--dirmngr-program FILE’
     Specify the directory manager (keyserver client) program to be
     started if none is running.  This has only an effect if used
     together with the option ‘--dirmngr’.

‘--keyboxd-program FILE’
     Specify the keybox daemon program to be started if none is running.
     This has only an effect if used together with the option
     ‘--keyboxd’.

‘-r FILE’
‘--run FILE’
     Run the commands from FILE at startup and then continue with the
     regular input method.  Note, that commands given on the command
     line are executed after this file.

‘-s’
‘--subst’
     Run the command ‘/subst’ at startup.

‘--hex’
     Print data lines in a hex format and the ASCII representation of
     non-control characters.

‘--decode’
     Decode data lines.  That is to remove percent escapes but make sure
     that a new line always starts with a D and a space.

‘-u’
‘--unbuffered’
     Set stdin and stdout into unbuffered I/O mode.  This this sometimes
     useful for scripting.

10.7.2 Control commands
-----------------------

While reading Assuan commands, gpg-agent also allows a few special
commands to control its operation.  These control commands all start
with a slash (‘/’).

‘/echo ARGS’
     Just print ARGS.

‘/let NAME VALUE’
     Set the variable NAME to VALUE.  Variables are only substituted on
     the input if the ‘/subst’ has been used.  Variables are referenced
     by prefixing the name with a dollar sign and optionally include the
     name in curly braces.  The rules for a valid name are identically
     to those of the standard bourne shell.  This is not yet enforced
     but may be in the future.  When used with curly braces no leading
     or trailing white space is allowed.

     If a variable is not found, it is searched in the environment and
     if found copied to the table of variables.

     Variable functions are available: The name of the function must be
     followed by at least one space and the at least one argument.  The
     following functions are available:

     ‘get’
          Return a value described by the argument.  Available arguments
          are:

          ‘cwd’
               The current working directory.
          ‘homedir’
               The gnupg homedir.
          ‘sysconfdir’
               GnuPG&#39;s system configuration directory.
          ‘bindir’
               GnuPG&#39;s binary directory.
          ‘libdir’
               GnuPG&#39;s library directory.
          ‘libexecdir’
               GnuPG&#39;s library directory for executable files.
          ‘datadir’
               GnuPG&#39;s data directory.
          ‘serverpid’
               The PID of the current server.  Command ‘/serverpid’ must
               have been given to return a useful value.

     ‘unescape ARGS’
          Remove C-style escapes from ARGS.  Note that ‘\0’ and ‘\x00’
          terminate the returned string implicitly.  The string to be
          converted are the entire arguments right behind the delimiting
          space of the function name.

     ‘unpercent ARGS’
     ‘unpercent+ ARGS’
          Remove percent style escaping from ARGS.  Note that ‘%00’
          terminates the string implicitly.  The string to be converted
          are the entire arguments right behind the delimiting space of
          the function name.  ‘unpercent+’ also maps plus signs to a
          spaces.

     ‘percent ARGS’
     ‘percent+ ARGS’
          Escape the ARGS using percent style escaping.  Tabs,
          formfeeds, linefeeds, carriage returns and colons are escaped.
          ‘percent+’ also maps spaces to plus signs.

     ‘errcode ARG’
     ‘errsource ARG’
     ‘errstring ARG’
          Assume ARG is an integer and evaluate it using ‘strtol’.
          Return the gpg-error error code, error source or a formatted
          string with the error code and error source.

     ‘+’
     ‘-’
     ‘*’
     ‘/’
     ‘%’
          Evaluate all arguments as long integers using ‘strtol’ and
          apply this operator.  A division by zero yields an empty
          string.

     ‘!’
     ‘|’
     ‘&amp;’
          Evaluate all arguments as long integers using ‘strtol’ and
          apply the logical operators NOT, OR or AND. The NOT operator
          works on the last argument only.

‘/definq NAME VAR’
     Use content of the variable VAR for inquiries with NAME.  NAME may
     be an asterisk (‘*’) to match any inquiry.

‘/definqfile NAME FILE’
     Use content of FILE for inquiries with NAME.  NAME may be an
     asterisk (‘*’) to match any inquiry.

‘/definqprog NAME PROG’
     Run PROG for inquiries matching NAME and pass the entire line to it
     as command line arguments.

‘/datafile NAME’
     Write all data lines from the server to the file NAME.  The file is
     opened for writing and created if it does not exists.  An existing
     file is first truncated to 0.  The data written to the file fully
     decoded.  Using a single dash for NAME writes to stdout.  The file
     is kept open until a new file is set using this command or this
     command is used without an argument.

‘/showdef’
     Print all definitions

‘/cleardef’
     Delete all definitions

‘/sendfd FILE MODE’
     Open FILE in MODE (which needs to be a valid ‘fopen’ mode string)
     and send the file descriptor to the server.  This is usually
     followed by a command like ‘INPUT FD’ to set the input source for
     other commands.

‘/recvfd’
     Not yet implemented.

‘/open VAR FILE [MODE]’
     Open FILE and assign the file descriptor to VAR.  Warning: This
     command is experimental and might change in future versions.

‘/close FD’
     Close the file descriptor FD.  Warning: This command is
     experimental and might change in future versions.

‘/showopen’
     Show a list of open files.

‘/serverpid’
     Send the Assuan command ‘GETINFO pid’ to the server and store the
     returned PID for internal purposes.

‘/sleep’
     Sleep for a second.

‘/hex’
‘/nohex’
     Same as the command line option ‘--hex’.

‘/decode’
‘/nodecode’
     Same as the command line option ‘--decode’.

‘/subst’
‘/nosubst’
     Enable and disable variable substitution.  It defaults to disabled
     unless the command line option ‘--subst’ has been used.  If /subst
     as been enabled once, leading whitespace is removed from input
     lines which makes scripts easier to read.

‘/while CONDITION’
‘/end’
     These commands provide a way for executing loops.  All lines
     between the ‘while’ and the corresponding ‘end’ are executed as
     long as the evaluation of CONDITION yields a non-zero value or is
     the string ‘true’ or ‘yes’.  The evaluation is done by passing
     CONDITION to the ‘strtol’ function.  Example:

            /subst
            /let i 3
            /while $i
              /echo loop counter is $i
              /let i ${- $i 1}
            /end

‘/if CONDITION’
‘/end’
     These commands provide a way for conditional execution.  All lines
     between the ‘if’ and the corresponding ‘end’ are executed only if
     the evaluation of CONDITION yields a non-zero value or is the
     string ‘true’ or ‘yes’.  The evaluation is done by passing
     CONDITION to the ‘strtol’ function.

‘/run FILE’
     Run commands from FILE.

‘/history --clear’
     Clear the command history.

‘/bye’
     Terminate the connection and the program.

‘/help’
     Print a list of available control commands.

10.8 The Dirmngr Client Tool
============================

The ‘dirmngr-client’ is a simple tool to contact a running dirmngr and
test whether a certificate has been revoked -- either by being listed in
the corresponding CRL or by running the OCSP protocol.  If no dirmngr is
running, a new instances will be started but this is in general not a
good idea due to the huge performance overhead.

The usual way to run this tool is either:

     dirmngr-client ACERT

or

     dirmngr-client &lt;ACERT

   Where ACERT is one DER encoded (binary) X.509 certificates to be
tested.  The return value of this command is

‘0’
     The certificate under question is valid; i.e.  there is a valid CRL
     available and it is not listed there or the OCSP request returned
     that that certificate is valid.

‘1’
     The certificate has been revoked

‘2 (and other values)’
     There was a problem checking the revocation state of the
     certificate.  A message to stderr has given more detailed
     information.  Most likely this is due to a missing or expired CRL
     or due to a network problem.

‘dirmngr-client’ may be called with the following options:

‘--version’
     Print the program version and licensing information.  Note that you
     cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--help, -h’
     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line
     options.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

‘--quiet, -q’
     Make the output extra brief by suppressing any informational
     messages.

‘-v’
‘--verbose’
     Outputs additional information while running.  You can increase the
     verbosity by giving several verbose commands to DIRMNGR, such as
     ‘-vv’.

‘--pem’
     Assume that the given certificate is in PEM (armored) format.

‘--ocsp’
     Do the check using the OCSP protocol and ignore any CRLs.

‘--force-default-responder’
     When checking using the OCSP protocol, force the use of the default
     OCSP responder.  That is not to use the Reponder as given by the
     certificate.

‘--ping’
     Check whether the dirmngr daemon is up and running.

‘--cache-cert’
     Put the given certificate into the cache of a running dirmngr.
     This is mainly useful for debugging.

‘--validate’
     Validate the given certificate using dirmngr&#39;s internal validation
     code.  This is mainly useful for debugging.

‘--load-crl’
     This command expects a list of filenames with DER encoded CRL
     files.  With the option ‘--url’ URLs are expected in place of
     filenames and they are loaded directly from the given location.
     All CRLs will be validated and then loaded into dirmngr&#39;s cache.

‘--lookup’
     Take the remaining arguments and run a lookup command on each of
     them.  The results are Base-64 encoded outputs (without header
     lines).  This may be used to retrieve certificates from a server.
     However the output format is not very well suited if more than one
     certificate is returned.

‘--url’
‘-u’
     Modify the ‘lookup’ and ‘load-crl’ commands to take an URL.

‘--local’
‘-l’
     Let the ‘lookup’ command only search the local cache.

‘--squid-mode’
     Run DIRMNGR-CLIENT in a mode suitable as a helper program for
     Squid&#39;s ‘external_acl_type’ option.

10.9 Parse a mail message into an annotated format
==================================================

The ‘gpgparsemail’ is a utility currently only useful for debugging.
Run it with ‘--help’ for usage information.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpgtar,  Next: gpg-check-pattern,  Prev: gpgparsemail,  Up: Helper Tools

10.10 Encrypt or sign files into an archive
===========================================

‘gpgtar’ encrypts or signs files into an archive.  It is an gpg-ized tar
using the same format as used by PGP&#39;s PGP Zip.

‘gpgtar’ is invoked this way:

     gpgtar [options] FILENAME1 [FILENAME2, ...] DIRECTORY [DIRECTORY2, ...]

‘gpgtar’ understands these options:

‘--create’
     Put given files and directories into a vanilla &quot;ustar&quot; archive.

‘--extract’
     Extract all files from a vanilla &quot;ustar&quot; archive.  If no file name
     is given (or it is &quot;-&quot;) the archive is taken from stdin.

‘--encrypt’
‘-e’
     Encrypt given files and directories into an archive.  This option
     may be combined with option ‘--symmetric’ for an archive that may
     be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase.

‘--decrypt’
‘-d’
     Extract all files from an encrypted archive.  If no file name is
     given (or it is &quot;-&quot;) the archive is taken from stdin.

‘--sign’
‘-s’
     Make a signed archive from the given files and directories.  This
     can be combined with option ‘--encrypt’ to create a signed and then
     encrypted archive.

‘--list-archive’
‘-t’
     List the contents of the specified archive.  If no file name is
     given (or it is &quot;-&quot;) the archive is taken from stdin.

‘--symmetric’
‘-c’
     Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  The default
     symmetric cipher used is AES-128, but may be chosen with the
     ‘--cipher-algo’ option to ‘gpg’.

‘--recipient USER’
‘-r USER’
     Encrypt for user id USER.  For details see ‘gpg’.

‘--local-user USER’
‘-u USER’
     Use USER as the key to sign with.  For details see ‘gpg’.

‘--output FILE’
‘-o FILE’
     Write the archive to the specified file FILE.

‘--verbose’
‘-v’
     Enable extra informational output.

‘--quiet’
‘-q’
     Try to be as quiet as possible.

‘--skip-crypto’
     Skip all crypto operations and create or extract vanilla &quot;ustar&quot;
     archives.

‘--dry-run’
     Do not actually output the extracted files.

‘--directory DIR’
‘-C DIR’
     Extract the files into the directory DIR.  The default is to take
     the directory name from the input filename.  If no input filename
     is known a directory named ‘GPGARCH’ is used.  For tarball
     creation, switch to directory DIR before performing any operations.

‘--files-from FILE’
‘-T FILE’
     Take the file names to work from the file FILE; one file per line.

‘--null’
     Modify option ‘--files-from’ to use a binary nul instead of a
     linefeed to separate file names.

‘--utf8-strings’
     Assume that the file names read by ‘--files-from’ are UTF-8
     encoded.  This option has an effect only on Windows where the
     active code page is otherwise assumed.

‘--openpgp’
     This option has no effect because OpenPGP encryption and signing is
     the default.

‘--cms’
     This option is reserved and shall not be used.  It will eventually
     be used to encrypt or sign using the CMS protocol; but that is not
     yet implemented.

‘--batch’
     Use batch mode.  Never ask but use the default action.  This option
     is passed directly to ‘gpg’.

‘--yes’
     Assume &quot;yes&quot; on most questions.  Often used together with ‘--batch’
     to overwrite existing files.  This option is passed directly to
     ‘gpg’.

‘--no’
     Assume &quot;no&quot; on most questions.  This option is passed directly to
     ‘gpg’.

‘--require-compliance’
     This option is passed directly to ‘gpg’.

‘--status-fd N’
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  See the
     file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

‘--with-log’
     When extracting an encrypted tarball also write a log file with the
     gpg output to a file named after the extraction directory with the
     suffix &quot;.log&quot;.

‘--set-filename FILE’
     Use the last component of FILE as the output directory.  The
     default is to take the directory name from the input filename.  If
     no input filename is known a directory named ‘GPGARCH’ is used.
     This option is deprecated in favor of option ‘--directory’.

‘--no-compress’
     This option tells gpg to disable compression (i.e.  using option
     -z0).  It is useful for archiving only large files which are are
     already compressed (e.g.  a set of videos).

‘--gpg GPGCMD’
     Use the specified command GPGCMD instead of ‘gpg’.

‘--gpg-args ARGS’
     Pass the specified extra options to ‘gpg’.

‘--tar-args ARGS’
     Assume ARGS are standard options of the command ‘tar’ and parse
     them.  The only supported tar options are &quot;-directory&quot;,
     &quot;-files-from&quot;, and &quot;-null&quot; This is an obsolete options because
     those supported tar options can also be given directly.

‘--tar COMMAND’
     This is a dummy option for backward compatibility.

‘--version’
     Print version of the program and exit.

‘--help’
     Display a brief help page and exit.

The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 otherwise.

Some examples:

Encrypt the contents of directory ‘mydocs’ for user Bob to file ‘test1’:

     gpgtar --encrypt --output test1 -r Bob mydocs

List the contents of archive ‘test1’:

     gpgtar --list-archive test1

10.11 Check a passphrase on stdin against the patternfile
=========================================================

‘gpg-check-pattern’ checks a passphrase given on stdin against a
specified pattern file.

   The pattern file is line based with comment lines beginning on the
_first_ position with a ‘#’.  Empty lines and lines with only white
spaces are ignored.  The actual pattern lines may either be verbatim
string pattern and match as they are (trailing spaces are ignored) or
extended regular expressions indicated by a ‘/’ or ‘!/’ in the first
column and terminated by another ‘/’ or end of line.  If a regular
expression starts with ‘!/’ the match result is reversed.  By default
all comparisons are case insensitive.

   Tag lines may be used to further control the operation of this tool.
The currently defined tags are:

‘[icase]’
     Switch to case insensitive comparison for all further patterns.
     This is the default.

‘[case]’
     Switch to case sensitive comparison for all further patterns.

‘[reject]’
     Switch to reject mode.  This is the default mode.

‘[accept]’
     Switch to accept mode.

   In the future more tags may be introduced and thus it is advisable
not to start a plain pattern string with an open bracket.  The tags must
be given verbatim on the line with no spaces to the left or any non
white space characters to the right.

   In reject mode the program exits on the first match with an exit code
of 1 (failure).  If at the end of the pattern list the reject mode is
still active the program exits with code 0 (success).

   In accept mode blocks of patterns are used.  A block starts at the
next pattern after an &quot;accept&quot; tag and ends with the last pattern before
the next &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;reject&quot; tag or at the end of the pattern list.  If
all patterns in a block match the program exits with an exit code of 0
(success).  If any pattern in a block do not match the next pattern
block is evaluated.  If at the end of the pattern list the accept mode
is still active the program exits with code 1 (failure).

‘--verbose’
     Enable extra informational output.

‘--check’
     Run only a syntax check on the patternfile.

‘--null’
     Input is expected to be null delimited.

11 Web Key Service
******************

GnuPG comes with tools used to maintain and access a Web Key Directory.

* Menu:

* gpg-wks-client::        Send requests via WKS
* gpg-wks-server::        Server to provide the WKS.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpg-wks-client,  Next: gpg-wks-server,  Up: Web Key Service

11.1 Send requests via WKS
==========================

The ‘gpg-wks-client’ is used to send requests to a Web Key Service
provider.  This is usually done to upload a key into a Web Key
Directory.

   With the ‘--supported’ command the caller can test whether a site
supports the Web Key Service.  The argument is an arbitrary address in
the to be tested domain.  For example ‘foo@example.net’.  The command
returns success if the Web Key Service is supported.  The operation is
silent; to get diagnostic output use the option ‘--verbose’.  See option
‘--with-colons’ for a variant of this command.

   With the ‘--check’ command the caller can test whether a key exists
for a supplied mail address.  The command returns success if a key is
available.

   The ‘--create’ command is used to send a request for publication in
the Web Key Directory.  The arguments are the fingerprint of the key and
the user id to publish.  The output from the command is a properly
formatted mail with all standard headers.  This mail can be fed to
‘sendmail(8)’ or any other tool to actually send that mail.  If
‘sendmail(8)’ is installed the option ‘--send’ can be used to directly
send the created request.  If the provider request a &#39;mailbox-only&#39; user
id and no such user id is found, ‘gpg-wks-client’ will try an additional
user id.

   The ‘--receive’ and ‘--read’ commands are used to process
confirmation mails as send from the service provider.  The former
expects an encrypted MIME messages, the latter an already decrypted MIME
message.  The result of these commands are another mail which can be
send in the same way as the mail created with ‘--create’.

   The command ‘--install-key’ manually installs a key into a local
directory (see option ‘-C’) reflecting the structure of a WKD. The
arguments are a file with the keyblock and the user-id to install.  If
the first argument resembles a fingerprint the key is taken from the
current keyring; to force the use of a file, prefix the first argument
with &quot;./&quot;.  If no arguments are given the parameters are read from
stdin; the expected format are lines with the fingerprint and the
mailbox separated by a space.  The command ‘--remove-key’ removes a key
from that directory, its only argument is a user-id.

   The command ‘--mirror’ is similar to ‘--install-key’ but takes the
keys from the the LDAP server configured for Dirmngr.  If no arguments
are given all keys and user ids are installed.  If arguments are given
they are taken as domain names to limit the to be installed keys.  The
option ‘--blacklist’ may be used to further limit the to be installed
keys.

   The command ‘--print-wkd-hash’ prints the WKD user-id identifiers and
the corresponding mailboxes from the user-ids given on the command line
or via stdin (one user-id per line).

   The command ‘--print-wkd-url’ prints the URLs used to fetch the key
for the given user-ids from WKD. The meanwhile preferred format with
sub-domains is used here.

‘gpg-wks-client’ understands these options:

‘--send’
     Directly send created mails using the ‘sendmail’ command.  Requires
     installation of that command.

‘--with-colons’
     This option has currently only an effect on the ‘--supported’
     command.  If it is used all arguments on the command line are taken
     as domain names and tested for WKD support.  The output format is
     one line per domain with colon delimited fields.  The currently
     specified fields are (future versions may specify additional
     fields):

     1 - domain
          This is the domain name.  Although quoting is not required for
          valid domain names this field is specified to be quoted in
          standard C manner.

     2 - WKD
          If the value is true the domain supports the Web Key
          Directory.

     3 - WKS
          If the value is true the domain supports the Web Key Service
          protocol to upload keys to the directory.

     4 - error-code
          This may contain an gpg-error code to describe certain
          failures.  Use ‘gpg-error CODE’ to explain the code.

     5 - protocol-version
          The minimum protocol version supported by the server.

     6 - auth-submit
          The auth-submit flag from the policy file of the server.

     7 - mailbox-only
          The mailbox-only flag from the policy file of the server.

‘--output FILE’
‘-o’
     Write the created mail to FILE instead of stdout.  Note that the
     value ‘-’ for FILE is the same as writing to stdout.  If this
     option is used with the ‘--check’ command and a key was found it is
     written to the given file.

‘--status-fd N’
     Write special status strings to the file descriptor N.  This
     program returns only the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which
     are helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can&#39;t
     easily get the return code of the process.

‘-C DIR’
‘--directory DIR’
     Use DIR as top level directory for the commands ‘--mirror’,
     ‘--install-key’ and ‘--remove-key’.  The default is ‘openpgpkey’.

‘--blacklist FILE’
     This option is used to exclude certain mail addresses from a mirror
     operation.  The format of FILE is one mail address (just the
     addrspec, e.g.  &quot;postel@isi.edu&quot;) per line.  Empty lines and lines
     starting with a &#39;#&#39; are ignored.

‘--add-revocs’
‘--no-add-revocs’
     If enabled append revocation certificates for the same addrspec as
     used in the WKD to the key.  Modern gpg version are able to import
     and apply them for existing keys.  Note that when used with the
     ‘--mirror’ command the revocation are searched in the local keyring
     and not in an LDAP directory.  The default is ‘--add-revocs’.

‘--verbose’
     Enable extra informational output.

‘--quiet’
     Disable almost all informational output.

‘--version’
     Print version of the program and exit.

‘--help’
     Display a brief help page and exit.

Examples

To use the services with clients lacking integrated support, the mailcap
mechanism can be used.  Simply put:
     application/vnd.gnupg.wks; \
       /usr/bin/gpg-wks-client -v --read --send; \
       needsterminal; \
       description=WKS message
   into the ‘/etc/mailcap’.  This assumes that a /usr/lib/sendmail is
installed.  With this configuration any real mail programs will run
gpg-wks-client for messages received from a Web Key Service.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: gpg-wks-server,  Prev: gpg-wks-client,  Up: Web Key Service

11.2 Provide the Web Key Service
================================

The ‘gpg-wks-server’ is a server side implementation of the Web Key
Service.  It receives requests for publication, sends confirmation
requests, receives confirmations, and published the key.  It also has
features to ease the setup and maintenance of a Web Key Directory.

   When used with the command ‘--receive’ a single Web Key Service mail
is processed.  Commonly this command is used with the option ‘--send’ to
directly send the created mails back.  See below for an installation
example.

   The command ‘--cron’ is used for regular cleanup tasks.  For example
non-confirmed requested should be removed after their expire time.  It
is best to run this command once a day from a cronjob.

   The command ‘--list-domains’ prints all configured domains.  Further
it creates missing directories for the configuration and prints warnings
pertaining to problems in the configuration.

   The command ‘--check-key’ (or just ‘--check’) checks whether a key
with the given user-id is installed.  The process returns success in
this case; to also print a diagnostic use the option ‘-v’.  If the key
is not installed a diagnostic is printed and the process returns
failure; to suppress the diagnostic, use option ‘-q’.  More than one
user-id can be given; see also option ‘with-file’.

   The command ‘--install-key’ manually installs a key into the WKD. The
arguments are a file with the keyblock and the user-id to install.  If
the first argument resembles a fingerprint the key is taken from the
current keyring; to force the use of a file, prefix the first argument
with &quot;./&quot;.  If no arguments are given the parameters are read from
stdin; the expected format are lines with the fingerprint and the
mailbox separated by a space.

   The command ‘--remove-key’ uninstalls a key from the WKD. The process
returns success in this case; to also print a diagnostic, use option
‘-v’.  If the key is not installed a diagnostic is printed and the
process returns failure; to suppress the diagnostic, use option ‘-q’.

   The command ‘--revoke-key’ is not yet functional.

‘gpg-wks-server’ understands these options:

‘-C DIR’
‘--directory DIR’
     Use DIR as top level directory for domains.  The default is
     ‘/var/lib/gnupg/wks’.

‘--from MAILADDR’
     Use MAILADDR as the default sender address.

‘--header NAME=VALUE’
     Add the mail header &quot;NAME: VALUE&quot; to all outgoing mails.

‘--send’
     Directly send created mails using the ‘sendmail’ command.  Requires
     installation of that command.

‘-o FILE’
‘--output FILE’
     Write the created mail also to FILE.  Note that the value ‘-’ for
     FILE would write it to stdout.

‘--with-dir’
     When used with the command ‘--list-domains’ print for each
     installed domain the domain name and its directory name.

‘--with-file’
     When used with the command ‘--check-key’ print for each user-id,
     the address, &#39;i&#39; for installed key or &#39;n&#39; for not installed key,
     and the filename.

‘--verbose’
     Enable extra informational output.

‘--quiet’
     Disable almost all informational output.

‘--version’
     Print version of the program and exit.

‘--help’
     Display a brief help page and exit.

Examples
********

The Web Key Service requires a working directory to store keys pending
for publication.  As root create a working directory:

       # mkdir /var/lib/gnupg/wks
       # chown webkey:webkey /var/lib/gnupg/wks
       # chmod 2750 /var/lib/gnupg/wks

   Then under your webkey account create directories for all your
domains.  Here we do it for &quot;example.net&quot;:

       $ mkdir /var/lib/gnupg/wks/example.net

   Finally run

       $ gpg-wks-server --list-domains

   to create the required sub-directories with the permissions set
correctly.  For each domain a submission address needs to be configured.
All service mails are directed to that address.  It can be the same
address for all configured domains, for example:

       $ cd /var/lib/gnupg/wks/example.net
       $ echo key-submission@example.net &gt;submission-address

   The protocol requires that the key to be published is sent with an
encrypted mail to the service.  Thus you need to create a key for the
submission address:

       $ gpg --batch --passphrase &#39;&#39; --quick-gen-key key-submission@example.net
       $ gpg -K key-submission@example.net

   The output of the last command looks similar to this:

       sec   rsa3072 2016-08-30 [SC]
             C0FCF8642D830C53246211400346653590B3795B
       uid           [ultimate] key-submission@example.net
                     bxzcxpxk8h87z1k7bzk86xn5aj47intu@example.net
       ssb   rsa3072 2016-08-30 [E]

   Take the fingerprint from that output and manually publish the key:

       $ gpg-wks-server --install-key C0FCF8642D830C53246211400346653590B3795B \
       &gt;                key-submission@example.net

   Finally that submission address needs to be redirected to a script
running ‘gpg-wks-server’.  The ‘procmail’ command can be used for this:
Redirect the submission address to the user &quot;webkey&quot; and put this into

12.1 Creating a TLS server certificate
======================================

Here is a brief run up on how to create a server certificate.  It has
actually been done this way to get a certificate from CAcert to be used
on a real server.  It has only been tested with this CA, but there
shouldn&#39;t be any problem to run this against any other CA.

   We start by generating an X.509 certificate signing request.  As
there is no need for a configuration file, you may simply enter:

       $ gpgsm --generate-key &gt;example.com.cert-req.pem
       Please select what kind of key you want:
          (1) RSA
          (2) Existing key
          (3) Existing key from card
       Your selection? 1

   I opted for creating a new RSA key.  The other option is to use an
already existing key, by selecting ‘2’ and entering the so-called
keygrip.  Running the command ‘gpgsm --dump-secret-key USERID’ shows you
this keygrip.  Using ‘3’ offers another menu to create a certificate
directly from a smart card based key.

   Let&#39;s continue:

       What keysize do you want? (3072)
       Requested keysize is 3072 bits

   Hitting enter chooses the default RSA key size of 3072 bits.  Keys
smaller than 2048 bits are too weak on the modern Internet.  If you
choose a larger (stronger) key, your server will need to do more work.

       Possible actions for a RSA key:
          (1) sign, encrypt
          (2) sign
          (3) encrypt
       Your selection? 1

   Selecting &quot;sign&quot; enables use of the key for Diffie-Hellman key
exchange mechanisms (DHE and ECDHE) in TLS, which are preferred because
they offer forward secrecy.  Selecting &quot;encrypt&quot; enables RSA key
exchange mechanisms, which are still common in some places.  Selecting
both enables both key exchange mechanisms.

   Now for some real data:

       Enter the X.509 subject name: CN=example.com

   This is the most important value for a server certificate.  Enter
here the canonical name of your server machine.  You may add other
virtual server names later.

       E-Mail addresses (end with an empty line):
       &gt;

   We don&#39;t need email addresses in a TLS server certificate and CAcert
would anyway ignore such a request.  Thus just hit enter.

   If you want to create a client certificate for email encryption, this
would be the place to enter your mail address (e.g.  &lt;joe@example.org&gt;).
You may enter as many addresses as you like, however the CA may not
accept them all or reject the entire request.

       Enter DNS names (optional; end with an empty line):
       &gt; example.com
       &gt; www.example.com
       &gt;

   Here I entered the names of the services which the machine actually
provides.  You almost always want to include the canonical name here
too.  The browser will accept a certificate for any of these names.  As
usual the CA must approve all of these names.

       URIs (optional; end with an empty line):
       &gt;

   It is possible to insert arbitrary URIs into a certificate; for a
server certificate this does not make sense.

       Create self-signed certificate? (y/N)

   Since we are creating a certificate signing request, and not a full
certificate, we answer no here, or just hit enter for the default.

   We have now entered all required information and ‘gpgsm’ will display
what it has gathered and ask whether to create the certificate request:

       These parameters are used:
           Key-Type: RSA
           Key-Length: 3072
           Key-Usage: sign, encrypt
           Name-DN: CN=example.com
           Name-DNS: example.com
           Name-DNS: www.example.com

       Proceed with creation? (y/N) y

   ‘gpgsm’ will now start working on creating the request.  As this
includes the creation of an RSA key it may take a while.  During this
time you will be asked 3 times for a passphrase to protect the created
private key on your system.  A pop up window will appear to ask for it.
The first two prompts are for the new passphrase and for re-entering it;
the third one is required to actually create the certificate signing
request.

   When it is ready, you should see the final notice:

       Ready.  You should now send this request to your CA.

   Now, you may look at the created request:

       $ cat example.com.cert-req.pem
       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

       -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
       $

   You may now proceed by logging into your account at the CAcert
website, choose ‘Server Certificates - New’, check ‘sign by class 3 root
certificate’, paste the above request block into the text field and
click on ‘Submit’.

   If everything works out fine, a certificate will be shown.  Now run

     $ gpgsm --import

   and paste the certificate from the CAcert page into your terminal
followed by a Ctrl-D

       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
       MIIEIjCCAgqgAwIBAgIBTDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFADBUMRQwEgYDVQQKEwtDQWNl

       gpgsm: certificate imported

       gpgsm: total number processed: 1
       gpgsm:               imported: 1

   ‘gpgsm’ tells you that it has imported the certificate.  It is now
associated with the key you used when creating the request.  The root
certificate has not been found, so you may want to import it from the
CACert website.

   To see the content of your certificate, you may now enter:

       $ gpgsm -K example.com
       /home/foo/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
       ---------------------------
       Serial number: 4C
              Issuer: /CN=CAcert Class 3 Root/OU=http:\x2f\x2fwww.[...]
             Subject: /CN=example.com
                 aka: (dns-name example.com)
                 aka: (dns-name www.example.com)
            validity: 2015-07-01 16:20:51 through 2016-07-01 16:20:51
            key type: 3072 bit RSA
           key usage: digitalSignature keyEncipherment
       ext key usage: clientAuth (suggested), serverAuth (suggested), [...]
         fingerprint: 0F:9C:27:B2:DA:05:5F:CB:33:D8:19:E9:65:B9:4F:BD:B1:98:CC:57

   I used ‘-K’ above because this will only list certificates for which
a private key is available.  To see more details, you may use
‘--dump-secret-keys’ instead of ‘-K’.

   To make actual use of the certificate you need to install it on your
server.  Server software usually expects a PKCS\#12 file with key and
certificate.  To create such a file, run:

       $ gpgsm --export-secret-key-p12 -a &gt;example.com-cert.pem

   You will be asked for the passphrase as well as for a new passphrase
to be used to protect the PKCS\#12 file.  The file now contains the
certificate as well as the private key:

       $ cat example-cert.pem
       Issuer ...: /CN=CAcert Class 3 Root/OU=http:\x2f\x2fwww.CA[...]
       Serial ...: 4C
       Subject ..: /CN=example.com
           aka ..: (dns-name example.com)
           aka ..: (dns-name www.example.com)

       -----BEGIN PKCS12-----
       MIIHlwIBAzCCB5AGCSqGSIb37QdHAaCCB4EEggd9MIIHeTk1BJ8GCSqGSIb3DQEu
       [...many more lines...]
       -----END PKCS12-----
       $

   Copy this file in a secure way to the server, install it there and
delete the file then.  You may export the file again at any time as long
as it is available in GnuPG&#39;s private key database.

13 Notes pertaining to certain OSes
***********************************

GnuPG has been developed on GNU/Linux systems and is know to work on
almost all Free OSes.  All modern POSIX systems should be supported
right now, however there are probably a lot of smaller glitches we need
to fix first.  The major problem areas are:

   • We are planning to use file descriptor passing for interprocess
     communication.  This will allow us save a lot of resources and
     improve performance of certain operations a lot.  Systems not
     supporting this won&#39;t gain these benefits but we try to keep them
     working the standard way as it is done today.

   • We require more or less full POSIX compatibility.  This has been
     around for 15 years now and thus we don&#39;t believe it makes sense to
     support non POSIX systems anymore.  Well, we of course the usual
     workarounds for near POSIX systems well be applied.

     There is one exception of this rule: Systems based the Microsoft
     Windows API (called here _W32_) will be supported to some extend.

13.1 Microsoft Windows Notes
============================

Current limitations are:

   • ‘gpgconf’ does not create backup files, so in case of trouble your
     configuration file might get lost.

   • ‘watchgnupg’ is not available.  Logging to sockets is not possible.

   • The periodical smartcard status checking done by ‘scdaemon’ is not
     yet supported.

14 How to solve problems
************************

Everyone knows that software often does not do what it should do and
thus there is a need to track down problems.  We call this debugging in
a reminiscent to the moth jamming a relay in a Mark II box back in 1947.

   Most of the problems a merely configuration and user problems but
nevertheless they are the most annoying ones and responsible for many
gray hairs.  We try to give some guidelines here on how to identify and
solve the problem at hand.

* Menu:

* Debugging Tools::       Description of some useful tools.
* Debugging Hints::       Various hints on debugging.

14.1 Debugging Tools
====================

The GnuPG distribution comes with a couple of tools, useful to help find
and solving problems.

* Menu:

* kbxutil::        Scrutinizing a keybox file.

File: gnupg.info,  Node: kbxutil,  Up: Debugging Tools

14.1.1 Scrutinizing a keybox file
---------------------------------

A keybox is a file format used to store public keys along with meta
information and indices.  The commonly used one is the file
‘pubring.kbx’ in the ‘.gnupg’ directory.  It contains all X.509
certificates as well as OpenPGP keys.

When called the standard way, e.g.:

   ‘kbxutil ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx’

it lists all records (called blobs) with there meta-information in a
human readable format.

To see statistics on the keybox in question, run it using

   ‘kbxutil --stats ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx’

and you get an output like:

     Total number of blobs:       99
                    header:        1
                     empty:        0
                   openpgp:        0
                      x509:       98
               non flagged:       81
            secret flagged:        0
         ephemeral flagged:       17

   In this example you see that the keybox does not have any OpenPGP
keys but contains 98 X.509 certificates and a total of 17 keys or
certificates are flagged as ephemeral, meaning that they are only
temporary stored (cached) in the keybox and won&#39;t get listed using the
usual commands provided by ‘gpgsm’ or ‘gpg’.  81 certificates are stored
in a standard way and directly available from ‘gpgsm’.

To find duplicated certificates and keyblocks in a keybox file (this
should not occur but sometimes things go wrong), run it using

   ‘kbxutil --find-dups ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx’

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Debugging Hints,  Next: Common Problems,  Prev: Debugging Tools,  Up: Debugging

14.2 Various hints on debugging
===============================

   • How to find the IP address of a keyserver

     If a round robin URL of is used for a keyserver (e.g.
     subkeys.gnupg.org); it is not easy to see what server is actually
     used.  Using the keyserver debug option as in

           gpg --keyserver-options debug=1 -v --refresh-key 1E42B367

     is thus often helpful.  Note that the actual output depends on the
     backend and may change from release to release.

   • Logging on WindowsCE

     For development, the best logging method on WindowsCE is the use of
     remote debugging using a log file name of ‘tcp://&lt;ip-addr&gt;:&lt;port&gt;’.
     The command ‘watchgnupg’ may be used on the remote host to listen
     on the given port (*note option watchgnupg --tcp::).  For in the
     field tests it is better to make use of the logging facility
     provided by the ‘gpgcedev’ driver (part of libassuan); this is
     enabled by using a log file name of ‘GPG2:’ (*note option
     --log-file::).

File: gnupg.info,  Node: Common Problems,  Next: Architecture Details,  Prev: Debugging Hints,  Up: Debugging

14.3 Commonly Seen Problems
===========================

   • Error code ‘Not supported’ from Dirmngr

     Most likely the option ‘enable-ocsp’ is active for gpgsm but
     Dirmngr&#39;s OCSP feature has not been enabled using ‘allow-ocsp’ in
     ‘dirmngr.conf’.

   • The Curses based Pinentry does not work

     The far most common reason for this is that the environment
     variable ‘GPG_TTY’ has not been set correctly.  Make sure that it
     has been set to a real tty device and not just to ‘/dev/tty’; i.e.
     ‘GPG_TTY=tty’ is plainly wrong; what you want is ‘GPG_TTY=`tty`’ --
     note the back ticks.  Also make sure that this environment variable
     gets exported, that is you should follow up the setting with an
     ‘export GPG_TTY’ (assuming a Bourne style shell).  Even for GUI
     based Pinentries; you should have set ‘GPG_TTY’.  See the section
     on installing the ‘gpg-agent’ on how to do it.

   • SSH hangs while a popping up pinentry was expected

     SSH has no way to tell the gpg-agent what terminal or X display it
     is running on.  So when remotely logging into a box where a
     gpg-agent with SSH support is running, the pinentry will get popped
     up on whatever display the gpg-agent has been started.  To solve
     this problem you may issue the command

          echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent

     and the next pinentry will pop up on your display or screen.
     However, you need to kill the running pinentry first because only
     one pinentry may be running at once.  If you plan to use ssh on a
     new display you should issue the above command before invoking ssh
     or any other service making use of ssh.

   • Exporting a secret key without a certificate

     It may happen that you have created a certificate request using
     ‘gpgsm’ but not yet received and imported the certificate from the
     CA. However, you want to export the secret key to another machine
     right now to import the certificate over there then.  You can do
     this with a little trick but it requires that you know the
     approximate time you created the signing request.  By running the
     command

            ls -ltr ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d

     you get a listing of all private keys under control of ‘gpg-agent’.
     Pick the key which best matches the creation time and run the
     command

            /usr/lib/gnupg/gpg-protect-tool --p12-export \
               ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/FOO &gt;FOO.p12

     (Please adjust the path to ‘gpg-protect-tool’ to the appropriate
     location).  FOO is the name of the key file you picked (it should
     have the suffix ‘.key’).  A Pinentry box will pop up and ask you
     for the current passphrase of the key and a new passphrase to
     protect it in the pkcs#12 file.

     To import the created file on the machine you use this command:

            /usr/lib/gnupg/gpg-protect-tool --p12-import --store  FOO.p12

     You will be asked for the pkcs#12 passphrase and a new passphrase
     to protect the imported private key at its new location.

     Note that there is no easy way to match existing certificates with
     stored private keys because some private keys are used for Secure
     Shell or other purposes and don&#39;t have a corresponding certificate.

   • A root certificate does not verify

     A common problem is that the root certificate misses the required
     basicConstraints attribute and thus ‘gpgsm’ rejects this
     certificate.  An error message indicating &quot;no value&quot; is a sign for
     such a certificate.  You may use the ‘relax’ flag in
     ‘trustlist.txt’ to accept the certificate anyway.  Note that the
     fingerprint and this flag may only be added manually to
     ‘trustlist.txt’.

   • Error message: &quot;digest algorithm N has not been enabled&quot;

     The signature is broken.  You may try the option
     ‘--extra-digest-algo SHA256’ to workaround the problem.  The number
     N is the internal algorithm identifier; for example 8 refers to
     SHA-256.

   • The Windows version does not work under Wine

     When running the W32 version of ‘gpg’ under Wine you may get an
     error messages like:

          gpg: fatal: WriteConsole failed: Access denied

     The solution is to use the command ‘wineconsole’.

     Some operations like ‘--generate-key’ really want to talk to the
     console directly for increased security (for example to prevent the
     passphrase from appearing on the screen).  So, you should use
     ‘wineconsole’ instead of ‘wine’, which will launch a windows
     console that implements those additional features.

   • Why does GPG&#39;s -search-key list weird keys?

     For performance reasons the keyservers do not check the keys the
     same way ‘gpg’ does.  It may happen that the listing of keys
     available on the keyservers shows keys with wrong user IDs or with
     user Ids from other keys.  If you try to import this key, the bad
     keys or bad user ids won&#39;t get imported, though.  This is a bit
     unfortunate but we can&#39;t do anything about it without actually
     downloading the keys.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you

certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether

modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

     &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
     &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.

     To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified
     version&quot; of the earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.

     A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work&#39;s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work&#39;s users, your or third parties&#39; legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
     restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s &quot;contributor
     version&quot;.

     A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot;
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot;
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot;
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM&#39;S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type ‘show w’.  This is free software, and you are
     welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
     type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program&#39;s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an &quot;about box&quot;.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

Glossary
********

‘ARL’
     The _Authority Revocation List_ is technical identical to a CRL but
     used for CAs and not for end user certificates.

‘Chain model’
     Verification model for X.509 which uses the creation date of a
     signature as the date the validation starts and in turn checks that
     each certificate has been issued within the time frame, the issuing
     certificate was valid.  This allows the verification of signatures
     after the CA&#39;s certificate expired.  The validation test also
     required an online check of the certificate status.  The chain
     model is required by the German signature law.  See also _Shell
     model_.

‘CMS’
     The _Cryptographic Message Standard_ describes a message format for
     encryption and digital signing.  It is closely related to the X.509
     certificate format.  CMS was formerly known under the name ‘PKCS#7’
     and is described by ‘RFC3369’.

‘CRL’
     The _Certificate Revocation List_ is a list containing certificates
     revoked by the issuer.

‘CSR’
     The _Certificate Signing Request_ is a message send to a CA to ask
     them to issue a new certificate.  The data format of such a signing
     request is called PCKS#10.

‘OpenPGP’
     A data format used to build a PKI and to exchange encrypted or
     signed messages.  In contrast to X.509, OpenPGP also includes the
     message format but does not explicitly demand a specific PKI.
     However any kind of PKI may be build upon the OpenPGP protocol.

‘Keygrip’
     This term is used by GnuPG to describe a 20 byte hash value used to
     identify a certain key without referencing to a concrete protocol.
     It is used internally to access a private key.  Usually it is shown
     and entered as a 40 character hexadecimal formatted string.

‘OCSP’
     The _Online Certificate Status Protocol_ is used as an alternative
     to a CRL.  It is described in ‘RFC 2560’.

‘PSE’
     The _Personal Security Environment_ describes a database to store
     private keys.  This is either a smartcard or a collection of files
     on a disk; the latter is often called a Soft-PSE.

‘Shell model’
     The standard model for validation of certificates under X.509.  At
     the time of the verification all certificates must be valid and not
     expired.  See also _Chain model_.

‘X.509’
     Description of a PKI used with CMS. It is for example defined by
     ‘RFC3280’.
