1 Overview
**********

Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells.  Each
virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and,
in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI
X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g.  insert/delete line and support for
multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for each
virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to
move text regions between windows.

   When &#39;screen&#39; is called, it creates a single window with a shell in
it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you
can use the program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can
create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including
more shells), kill the current window, view a list of the active
windows, turn output logging on and off, copy text between windows, view
the scrollback history, switch between windows, etc.  All windows run
their programs completely independent of each other.  Programs continue
to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the
whole screen session is detached from the user&#39;s terminal.

   When a program terminates, &#39;screen&#39; (per default) kills the window
that contained it.  If this window was in the foreground, the display
switches to the previously displayed window; if none are left, &#39;screen&#39;
exits.  Shells usually distinguish between running as login-shell or
sub-shell.  Screen runs them as sub-shells, unless told otherwise (See
&#39;shell&#39; .screenrc command).

   Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current
window.  The only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to
initiate a command to the window manager.  By default, each command
begins with a control-a (abbreviated &#39;C-a&#39; from now on), and is followed
by one other keystroke.  The command character (*note Command
Character::) and all the key bindings (*note Key Binding::) can be fully
customized to be anything you like, though they are always two
characters in length.

   &#39;Screen&#39; does not understand the prefix &#39;C-&#39; to mean control,
although this notation is used in this manual for readability.  Please
use the caret notation (&#39;^A&#39; instead of &#39;C-a&#39;) as arguments to e.g.  the
&#39;escape&#39; command or the &#39;-e&#39; option.  &#39;Screen&#39; will also print out
control characters in caret notation.

   The standard way to create a new window is to type &#39;C-a c&#39;.  This
creates a new window running a shell and switches to that window
immediately, regardless of the state of the process running in the
current window.  Similarly, you can create a new window with a custom
command in it by first binding the command to a keystroke (in your
&#39;.screenrc&#39; file or at the &#39;C-a :&#39; command line) and then using it just
like the &#39;C-a c&#39; command.  In addition, new windows can be created by
running a command like:

     screen emacs prog.c

from a shell prompt within a previously created window.  This will not
run another copy of &#39;screen&#39;, but will instead supply the command name
and its arguments to the window manager (specified in the $STY
environment variable) who will use it to create the new window.  The
above example would start the &#39;emacs&#39; editor (editing &#39;prog.c&#39;) and
switch to its window.  - Note that you cannot transport environment
variables from the invoking shell to the application (emacs in this
case), because it is forked from the parent screen process, not from the
invoking shell.

   If &#39;/run/utmp&#39; is writable by &#39;screen&#39;, an appropriate record will be
written to this file for each window, and removed when the window is
closed.  This is useful for working with &#39;talk&#39;, &#39;script&#39;, &#39;shutdown&#39;,
&#39;rsend&#39;, &#39;sccs&#39; and other similar programs that use the utmp file to
determine who you are.  As long as &#39;screen&#39; is active on your terminal,
the terminal&#39;s own record is removed from the utmp file.  *Note Login::.

2 Getting Started
*****************

Before you begin to use &#39;screen&#39; you&#39;ll need to make sure you have
correctly selected your terminal type, just as you would for any other
termcap/terminfo program.  (You can do this by using &#39;tset&#39;, &#39;qterm&#39;, or
just &#39;set term=mytermtype&#39;, for example.)

   If you&#39;re impatient and want to get started without doing a lot more
reading, you should remember this one command: &#39;C-a ?&#39; (*note Key
Binding::).  Typing these two characters will display a list of the
available &#39;screen&#39; commands and their bindings.  Each keystroke is
discussed in the section on keystrokes (*note Default Key Bindings::).
Another section (*note Customization::) deals with the contents of your
&#39;.screenrc&#39;.

   If your terminal is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal (it doesn&#39;t allow
the last position on the screen to be updated without scrolling the
screen) consider using a version of your terminal&#39;s termcap that has
automatic margins turned _off_.  This will ensure an accurate and
optimal update of the screen in all circumstances.  Most terminals
nowadays have &quot;magic&quot; margins (automatic margins plus usable last
column).  This is the VT100 style type and perfectly suited for
&#39;screen&#39;.  If all you&#39;ve got is a &quot;true&quot; auto-margin terminal &#39;screen&#39;
will be content to use it, but updating a character put into the last
position on the screen may not be possible until the screen scrolls or
the character is moved into a safe position in some other way.  This
delay can be shortened by using a terminal with insert-character
capability.

   *Note Special Capabilities::, for more information about telling
&#39;screen&#39; what kind of terminal you have.

3 Invoking &#39;Screen&#39;
*******************

Screen has the following command-line options:

&#39;-a&#39;
     Include _all_ capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each
     window&#39;s termcap, even if &#39;screen&#39; must redraw parts of the display
     in order to implement a function.

&#39;-A&#39;
     Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the display.  By
     default, &#39;screen&#39; may try to restore its old window sizes when
     attaching to resizable terminals (those with &#39;WS&#39; in their
     descriptions, e.g.  &#39;suncmd&#39; or some varieties of &#39;xterm&#39;).

&#39;-c FILE&#39;
     Use FILE as the user&#39;s configuration file instead of the default of
     &#39;$HOME/.screenrc&#39;.

&#39;-d [PID.SESSIONNAME]&#39;
&#39;-D [PID.SESSIONNAME]&#39;
     Do not start &#39;screen&#39;, but instead detach a &#39;screen&#39; session
     running elsewhere (*note Detach::).  &#39;-d&#39; has the same effect as
     typing &#39;C-a d&#39; from the controlling terminal for the session.  &#39;-D&#39;
     is the equivalent to the power detach key.  If no session can be
     detached, this option is ignored.  In combination with the
     &#39;-r&#39;/&#39;-R&#39; option more powerful effects can be achieved:

     &#39;-d -r&#39;
          Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.
     &#39;-d -R&#39;
          Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it
          first.
     &#39;-d -RR&#39;
          Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it.  Use
          the first session if more than one session is available.
     &#39;-D -r&#39;
          Reattach a session.  If necessary detach and logout remotely
          first.
     &#39;-D -R&#39;
          Attach here and now.  In detail this means: If a session is
          running, then reattach.  If necessary detach and logout
          remotely first.  If it was not running create it and notify
          the user.  This is the author&#39;s favorite.
     &#39;-D -RR&#39;
          Attach here and now.  Whatever that means, just do it.

     _Note_: It is a good idea to check the status of your sessions with
     &#39;screen -list&#39; before using this option.

&#39;-e XY&#39;
     Set the command character to X, and the character generating a
     literal command character (when typed after the command character)
     to Y.  The defaults are &#39;C-a&#39; and &#39;a&#39;, which can be specified as
     &#39;-e^Aa&#39;.  When creating a &#39;screen&#39; session, this option sets the
     default command character.  In a multiuser session all users added
     will start off with this command character.  But when attaching to
     an already running session, this option only changes the command
     character of the attaching user.  This option is equivalent to the
     commands &#39;defescape&#39; or &#39;escape&#39; respectively.  (*note Command
     Character::).

&#39;-f&#39;
&#39;-fn&#39;
&#39;-fa&#39;
     Set flow-control to on, off, or automatic switching mode,
     respectively.  This option is equivalent to the &#39;defflow&#39; command
     (*note Flow Control::).

&#39;-h NUM&#39;
     Set the history scrollback buffer to be NUM lines high.  Equivalent
     to the &#39;defscrollback&#39; command (*note Copy::).

&#39;-i&#39;
     Cause the interrupt key (usually &#39;C-c&#39;) to interrupt the display
     immediately when flow control is on.  This option is equivalent to
     the &#39;interrupt&#39; argument to the &#39;defflow&#39; command (*note Flow
     Control::).  Its use is discouraged.

&#39;-l&#39;
&#39;-ln&#39;
     Turn login mode on or off (for &#39;/run/utmp&#39; updating).  This option
     is equivalent to the &#39;deflogin&#39; command (*note Login::).

&#39;-ls [MATCH]&#39;
&#39;-list [MATCH]&#39;
     Do not start &#39;screen&#39;, but instead print a list of session
     identification strings (usually of the form PID.TTY.HOST; *note
     Session Name::) and the corresponding creation timestamps.
     Sessions marked &#39;detached&#39; can be resumed with &#39;screen -r&#39;.  Those
     marked &#39;attached&#39; are running and have a controlling terminal.  If
     the session runs in multiuser mode, it is marked &#39;multi&#39;.  Sessions
     marked as &#39;unreachable&#39; either live on a different host or are
     dead.  An unreachable session is considered dead, when its name
     matches either the name of the local host, or the specified
     parameter, if any.  See the &#39;-r&#39; flag for a description how to
     construct matches.  Sessions marked as &#39;dead&#39; should be thoroughly
     checked and removed.  Ask your system administrator if you are not
     sure.  Remove sessions with the &#39;-wipe&#39; option.

&#39;-L&#39;
     Tell &#39;screen&#39; to turn on automatic output logging for the windows.

&#39;-Logfile &quot;file&quot;&#39;
     By default logfile name is &quot;screenlog.0&quot;.  You can set new logfile
     name with the &#39;-Logfile&#39; option.

&#39;-m&#39;
     Tell &#39;screen&#39; to ignore the &#39;$STY&#39; environment variable.  When this
     option is used, a new session will always be created, regardless of
     whether &#39;screen&#39; is being called from within another &#39;screen&#39;
     session or not.  This flag has a special meaning in connection with
     the &#39;-d&#39; option:
     &#39;-d -m&#39;
          Start &#39;screen&#39; in _detached_ mode.  This creates a new session
          but doesn&#39;t attach to it.  This is useful for system startup
          scripts.
     &#39;-D -m&#39;
          This also starts &#39;screen&#39; in _detached_ mode, but doesn&#39;t fork
          a new process.  The command exits if the session terminates.

&#39;-O&#39;
     Select a more optimal output mode for your terminal rather than
     true VT100 emulation (only affects auto-margin terminals without
     &#39;LP&#39;).  This can also be set in your &#39;.screenrc&#39; by specifying &#39;OP&#39;
     in the &#39;termcap&#39; command.

&#39;-p NAME_OR_NUMBER|-|=|+&#39;
     Preselect a window.  This is useful when you want to reattach to a
     specific window or you want to send a command via the &#39;-X&#39; option
     to a specific window.  As with screen&#39;s select command, &#39;-&#39; selects
     the blank window.  As a special case for reattach, &#39;=&#39; brings up
     the windowlist on the blank window, while a &#39;+&#39; will create new
     window.  The command will not be executed if the specified window
     could not be found.

&#39;-q&#39;
     Suppress printing of error messages.  In combination with &#39;-ls&#39; the
     exit value is set as follows: 9 indicates a directory without
     sessions.  10 indicates a directory with running but not attachable
     sessions.  11 (or more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions.  In
     combination with &#39;-r&#39; the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates
     that there is no session to resume.  12 (or more) indicates that
     there are 2 (or more) sessions to resume and you should specify
     which one to choose.  In all other cases &#39;-q&#39; has no effect.

&#39;-Q&#39;
     Some commands now can be queried from a remote session using this
     flag, e.g.  &#39;screen -Q windows&#39;.  The commands will send the
     response to the stdout of the querying process.  If there was an
     error in the command, then the querying process will exit with a
     non-zero status.

     The commands that can be queried now are: &#39;echo&#39; &#39;info&#39; &#39;lastmsg&#39;
     &#39;number&#39; &#39;select&#39; &#39;time&#39; &#39;title&#39; &#39;windows&#39;

&#39;-r [PID.SESSIONNAME]&#39;
&#39;-r SESSIONOWNER/[PID.SESSIONNAME]&#39;
     Resume a detached &#39;screen&#39; session.  No other options (except
     combinations with &#39;-d&#39; or &#39;-D&#39;) may be specified, though the
     session name (*note Session Name::) may be needed to distinguish
     between multiple detached &#39;screen&#39; sessions.  The second form is
     used to connect to another user&#39;s screen session which runs in
     multiuser mode.  This indicates that screen should look for
     sessions in another user&#39;s directory.  This requires setuid-root.

&#39;-R&#39;
     resumes screen only when it&#39;s unambiguous which one to attach,
     usually when only one &#39;screen&#39; is detached.  Otherwise lists
     available sessions.

&#39;-RR&#39;
     Resume the most-recently created appropriate detached &#39;screen&#39;
     session.  If successful, all other command-line options are
     ignored.  If no detached session exists, start a new session using
     the specified options, just as if &#39;-R&#39; had not been specified.
     This option is set by default if screen is run as a login-shell
     (actually screen uses &#39;-xRR&#39; in that case).  For combinations with
     the &#39;-D&#39;/&#39;-d&#39; option see there.  &#39;Note:&#39; Time-based session
     selection is a Debian addition.

&#39;-s PROGRAM&#39;
     Set the default shell to be PROGRAM.  By default, &#39;screen&#39; uses the
     value of the environment variable &#39;$SHELL&#39;, or &#39;/bin/sh&#39; if it is
     not defined.  This option is equivalent to the &#39;shell&#39; command
     (*note Shell::).  See also there.

&#39;-S SESSIONNAME&#39;
     Set the name of the new session to SESSIONNAME.  This option can be
     used to specify a meaningful name for the session in place of the
     default TTY.HOST suffix.  This name identifies the session for the
     &#39;screen -list&#39; and &#39;screen -r&#39; commands.  This option is equivalent
     to the &#39;sessionname&#39; command (*note Session Name::).

&#39;-t NAME&#39;
     Set the title (name) for the default shell or specified program.
     This option is equivalent to the &#39;shelltitle&#39; command (*note
     Shell::).

&#39;-T TERM&#39;
     Set the $TERM enviroment variable using the specified _term_ as
     opposed to the default setting of &#39;screen&#39;.

&#39;-U&#39;
     Run screen in UTF-8 mode.  This option tells screen that your
     terminal sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters.  It also
     sets the default encoding for new windows to &#39;utf8&#39;.

&#39;-v&#39;
     Print the version number.

&#39;-wipe [MATCH]&#39;
     List available screens like &#39;screen -ls&#39;, but remove destroyed
     sessions instead of marking them as &#39;dead&#39;.  An unreachable session
     is considered dead, when its name matches either the name of the
     local host, or the explicitly given parameter, if any.  See the
     &#39;-r&#39; flag for a description how to construct matches.

&#39;-x&#39;
     Attach to a session which is already attached elsewhere
     (multi-display mode).  &#39;Screen&#39; refuses to attach from within
     itself.  But when cascading multiple screens, loops are not
     detected; take care.

&#39;-X&#39;
     Send the specified command to a running screen session.  You may
     use the &#39;-S&#39; option to specify the screen session if you have
     several running.  You can use the &#39;-d&#39; or &#39;-r&#39; option to tell
     screen to look only for attached or detached screen sessions.  Note
     that this command doesn&#39;t work if the session is password
     protected.

4 Customizing &#39;Screen&#39;
**********************

You can modify the default settings for &#39;screen&#39; to fit your tastes
either through a personal &#39;.screenrc&#39; file which contains commands to be
executed at startup, or on the fly using the &#39;colon&#39; command.

* Menu:

* Startup Files::               The &#39;.screenrc&#39; file.
* Source::                      Read commands from a file.
* Colon::                       Entering customization commands interactively.

File: screen.info,  Node: Startup Files,  Next: Source,  Up: Customization

4.1 The &#39;.screenrc&#39; file
========================

When &#39;screen&#39; is invoked, it executes initialization commands from the
files &#39;.screenrc&#39; in the user&#39;s home directory and &#39;/etc/screenrc&#39;.
These defaults can be overridden in the following ways: For the global
screenrc file &#39;screen&#39; searches for the environment variable
&#39;$SYSSCREENRC&#39; (this override feature may be disabled at compile-time).
The user specific screenrc file is searched for in &#39;$SCREENRC&#39;, then
&#39;$HOME/.screenrc&#39;.  The command line option &#39;-c&#39; specifies which file to
use (*note Invoking Screen::).  Commands in these files are used to set
options, bind commands to keys, and to automatically establish one or
more windows at the beginning of your &#39;screen&#39; session.  Commands are
listed one per line, with empty lines being ignored.  A command&#39;s
arguments are separated by tabs or spaces, and may be surrounded by
single or double quotes.  A &#39;#&#39; turns the rest of the line into a
comment, except in quotes.  Unintelligible lines are warned about and
ignored.  Commands may contain references to environment variables.  The
syntax is the shell-like &#39;$VAR&#39; or &#39;${VAR}&#39;.  Note that this causes
incompatibility with previous &#39;screen&#39; versions, as now the
&#39;$&#39;-character has to be protected with &#39;\&#39; if no variable substitution
is intended.  A string in single-quotes is also protected from variable
substitution.

   Two configuration files are shipped as examples with your screen
distribution: &#39;etc/screenrc&#39; and &#39;etc/etcscreenrc&#39;.  They contain a
number of useful examples for various commands.

4.2 Source
==========

 -- Command: source file
     (none)
     Read and execute commands from file FILE.  Source commands may be
     nested to a maximum recursion level of ten.  If FILE is not an
     absolute path and screen is already processing a source command,
     the parent directory of the running source command file is used to
     search for the new command file before screen&#39;s current directory.

     Note that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at
     startup and reattach time, so they must be reached via the default
     screenrc files to have an effect.

4.3 Colon
=========

Customization can also be done online, with this command:

 -- Command: colon
     (&#39;C-a :&#39;)
     Allows you to enter &#39;.screenrc&#39; command lines.  Useful for
     on-the-fly modification of key bindings, specific window creation
     and changing settings.  Note that the &#39;set&#39; keyword no longer
     exists, as of version 3.3.  Change default settings with commands
     starting with &#39;def&#39;.  You might think of this as the &#39;ex&#39; command
     mode of &#39;screen&#39;, with &#39;copy&#39; as its &#39;vi&#39; command mode (*note Copy
     and Paste::).

5 Commands
**********

A command in &#39;screen&#39; can either be bound to a key, invoked from a
screenrc file, or called from the &#39;colon&#39; prompt (*note
Customization::).  As of version 3.3, all commands can be bound to keys,
although some may be less useful than others.  For a number of real life
working examples of the most important commands see the files
&#39;etc/screenrc&#39; and &#39;etc/etcscreenrc&#39; of your screen distribution.

   In this manual, a command definition looks like this:

- Command: command [-n] ARG1 [ARG2] ...
     (KEYBINDINGS)
     This command does something, but I can&#39;t remember what.

   An argument in square brackets (&#39;[]&#39;) is optional.  Many commands
take an argument of &#39;on&#39; or &#39;off&#39;, which is indicated as STATE in the
definition.

5.1 Default Key Bindings
========================

As mentioned previously, each keyboard command consists of a &#39;C-a&#39;
followed by one other character.  For your convenience, all commands
that are bound to lower-case letters are also bound to their control
character counterparts (with the exception of &#39;C-a a&#39;; see below).
Thus, both &#39;C-a c&#39; and &#39;C-a C-c&#39; can be used to create a window.

6 New Window
************

This section describes the commands for creating a new window for
running programs.  When a new window is created, the first available
number is assigned to it.  The number of windows is set by the MAXWIN
configuration parameter (which defaults to 100), but it can be changed
by using &#39;maxwin&#39; command.

* Menu:

* Chdir::                       Change the working directory for new windows.
* Screen Command::              Create a new window.
* Setenv::                      Set environment variables for new windows.
* Shell::                       Parameters for shell windows.
* Term::                        Set the terminal type for new windows.
* Window Types::                Creating different types of windows.
* Window Groups::               Grouping windows together

File: screen.info,  Node: Chdir,  Next: Screen Command,  Up: New Window

6.1 Chdir
=========

 -- Command: chdir [directory]
     (none)
     Change the current directory of &#39;screen&#39; to the specified directory
     or, if called without an argument, to your home directory (the
     value of the environment variable &#39;$HOME&#39;).  All windows that are
     created by means of the &#39;screen&#39; command from within &#39;.screenrc&#39; or
     by means of &#39;C-a : screen ...&#39; or &#39;C-a c&#39; use this as their default
     directory.  Without a &#39;chdir&#39; command, this would be the directory
     from which &#39;screen&#39; was invoked.  Hardcopy and log files are always
     written to the _window&#39;s_ default directory, _not_ the current
     directory of the process running in the window.  You can use this
     command multiple times in your &#39;.screenrc&#39; to start various windows
     in different default directories, but the last &#39;chdir&#39; value will
     affect all the windows you create interactively.

6.2 Screen Command
==================

 -- Command: screen [opts] [n] [cmd [args] | //GROUP]
     (&#39;C-a c&#39;, &#39;C-a C-c&#39;)
     Establish a new window.  The flow-control options (&#39;-f&#39;, &#39;-fn&#39; and
     &#39;-fa&#39;), title option (&#39;-t&#39;), login options (&#39;-l&#39; and &#39;-ln&#39;) ,
     terminal type option (&#39;-T TERM&#39;), the all-capability-flag (&#39;-a&#39;)
     and scrollback option (&#39;-h NUM&#39;) may be specified with each
     command.  The option (&#39;-M&#39;) turns monitoring on for this window.
     The option (&#39;-L&#39;) turns output logging on for this window.  If an
     optional number N in the range 0...MAXWIN-1 is given, the window
     number N is assigned to the newly created window (or, if this
     number is already in-use, the next available number).  If a command
     is specified after &#39;screen&#39;, this command (with the given
     arguments) is started in the window; otherwise, a shell is created.
     If &#39;//group&#39; is supplied, a container-type window is created in
     which other windows may be created inside it.  *Note Window
     Groups::.

     Screen has built in some functionality of &#39;cu&#39; and &#39;telnet&#39;.  *Note
     Window Types::.

   Thus, if your &#39;.screenrc&#39; contains the lines

     # example for .screenrc:
     screen 1
     screen -fn -t foobar 2 -L telnet foobar

&#39;screen&#39; creates a shell window (in window #1) and a window with a
TELNET connection to the machine foobar (with no flow-control using the
title &#39;foobar&#39; in window #2) and will write a logfile &#39;screenlog.2&#39; of
the telnet session.  If you do not include any &#39;screen&#39; commands in your
&#39;.screenrc&#39; file, then &#39;screen&#39; defaults to creating a single shell
window, number zero.  When the initialization is completed, &#39;screen&#39;
switches to the last window specified in your .screenrc file or, if
none, it opens default window #0.

6.3 Setenv
==========

 -- Command: setenv var string
     (none)
     Set the environment variable VAR to value STRING.  If only VAR is
     specified, the user will be prompted to enter a value.  If no
     parameters are specified, the user will be prompted for both
     variable and value.  The environment is inherited by all
     subsequently forked shells.

 -- Command: unsetenv var
     (none)
     Unset an environment variable.

File: screen.info,  Node: Shell,  Next: Term,  Prev: Setenv,  Up: New Window

6.4 Shell
=========

 -- Command: shell command
 -- Command: defshell command
     (none)
     Set the command to be used to create a new shell.  This overrides
     the value of the environment variable &#39;$SHELL&#39;.  This is useful if
     you&#39;d like to run a tty-enhancer which is expecting to execute the
     program specified in &#39;$SHELL&#39;.  If the command begins with a &#39;-&#39;
     character, the shell will be started as a login-shell.  Typical
     shells do only minimal initialization when not started as a
     login-shell.  E.g.  Bash will not read your &#39;~/.bash_profile&#39;
     unless it is a login-shell.

     &#39;defshell&#39; is currently a synonym to the &#39;shell&#39; .screenrc command.

 -- Command: shelltitle title
     (none)
     Set the title for all shells created during startup or by the C-a
     C-c command.  *Note Naming Windows::, for details about what titles
     are.
